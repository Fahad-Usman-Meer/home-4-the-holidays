  <h1>Darby the &ldquo;Ambassadog&rdquo;</h1>
  <p>Darby, a  6-year-old Rottweiler, was found as a stray with a purposeful chemical burn on  her back. The Good Samaritan who found her contacted Blue Buffalo Home 4 the  Holidays organization, <a href="http://www.plannedpethood.org/" target="_blank">Planned Pethood</a>,  who took her in and committed to finding her the care she needed.  </p>
  <p>Darby&rsquo;s  wounds, which consisted of first, second and third degree burns, spread across  her back and measured about 9 x 12 inches. A Planned Pethood foster family  agreed to care for Darby while she healed â€“ plus this foster home already had a  resident Rottweiler, bonus for Darby!</p>

  <p>Darby&rsquo;s two  topical medications required to be applied twice per day. Obviously, it was not  enjoyable for Darby and it was not very fun for her foster mom, too.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Her foster  mom quickly realized that having an extra set of hands made the process easier  for her and Darby. But since she lived alone, that required other volunteers to  come to her house twice a day. Our amazing volunteers were more than happy to  help. </p>
  <p>When first  seeing Darby&rsquo;s wounds everyone seemed to have the same reaction. They would  just stare at the area, speechless for several minutes, then attempt to form  the questions of why, how... WHO would do this? Despite the overwhelming,  intense&nbsp;wound Darby carried around on her back, she welcomed every new  visitor with a slight tail wiggle and a head nudge. The visitors&rsquo; job was to  feed Darby as many spoonfuls of peanut butter as she wanted while her foster  mom applied the medications. <br>
    After some  time, Darby&rsquo;s foster mom needed to return to her job, but Darby still needed to  be supervised to make sure she didn&rsquo;t scratch the itchy, healing skin. Our  Executive Director came up with the idea of Darby staying at her house during  the day. It was a perfect solution. Our ED worked from home and her husband  worked second shift. </p>

  <p>Darby was  dropped off every morning on her foster mom&rsquo;s way to work and picked up every  afternoon. During one of the days, our ED invented a contraption for Darby to  wear out of kids&rsquo; swimming noodles and an old t-shirt to prevent her back legs  from reaching the wound in order to scratch. It worked! A few details needed  tweaked and a talented supporter of ours drove from 45 minutes away armed with  her sewing machine and supplies, and used the original design to make another  design, right in Darby&rsquo;s foster home. They were lovingly called &quot;Darby&rsquo;s  tubes.&quot; This allowed Darby more freedom, better movement and she could  stay in her foster home during the weekdays without risk of tearing the wound  back open. </p>
  <p>All in all,  her recovery lasted four-and-a-half months.&nbsp;When it was time to offer her  for adoption, Darby and her foster mom decided they could not part with each  other. On October 10, 2010, Darby was adopted by her foster mom at the Rossford  PetSmart location.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>After her adoption, Darby became an  &quot;ambassadog&quot; for Planned Pethood, attending area adoption events and  educational talks, where her presence brought to life the plight of rescued  animals and the need to combat animal cruelty.<br>

    <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2011/06/13/Cancer-cancels-dog-s-2nd-chance-at-life.html">Sadly,  Darby passed away due to complications with cancer in June, 2011.</a> We honor  her and her inspiring story for being one of our favorite adopted pets of the  Blue Buffalo Home 4 the Holidays adoption campaign.</p>
