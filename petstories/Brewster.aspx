  <h1>Brewster the  Chihuahua: He&rsquo;s One in 10 Million</h1>
  <p><br>
    &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve probably seen the paw-shaped bumper sticker  &ldquo;Who Rescued Who?&rdquo; There is no better example of this than Brewster, a  pint-sized Chihuahua adopted last holiday season in Corona,  California.&nbsp;From foster care to his forever family, Brewster seems to  change the life of everyone he meets.</p>

  <p>You might say Brewster is one in a million, but he&rsquo;s  actually one in 10 million.&nbsp;<strong>Brewster  was the 10 millionth pet adopted through&nbsp;Blue Buffalo Home 4 the Holidays!</strong></p>
  <p>    This lovable little boy was not cut out for life on the  streets.&nbsp;<strong>To survive, Brewster had  to dodge coyotes and other stray dogs that would rough him up.&nbsp;</strong>During  these run-ins, the big dogs would flip him in the air and pin him to the  ground, making him cry in pain.</p>

  <p> He was hungry, too. Brewster started showing up at a  neighbor&rsquo;s gate as the man fed his own dogs, wagging his tail and hoping there  would be some food for him, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Eventually, the man couldn&rsquo;t bear seeing the hungry pup and brought  Brewster to the&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.icaredogrescue.org/" target="_blank"><strong>I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue.</strong></a><strong></strong></p>
  <p>    When Brewster arrived at I.C.A.R.E., he weighed only 5  pounds and his ribs were poking out. The brown and white Chihuahua was filthy,  covered in scabs and had broken teeth that desperately needed to be removed.  Yes, he was a mess, but the I.C.A.R.E. team didn&rsquo;t hesitate.&nbsp;<strong>They arranged his medical care and placed  him with foster mom Dana Stark who would be by his side for months of surgeries  and treatment.</strong></p>
  <p>    At first, little Brewster was terrified of his foster  family, perhaps because he had been abused by people in the past. Soon, he  warmed up, and his bright spirit started to shine through. After he learned to  walk on a leash, he would proudly prance like a tiny show horse, Dana said.</p>
  <p> <strong>Brewster started  accompanying Dana on trips to visit her sick mother-in-law in a rehabilitation  facility.</strong>&nbsp;The dog seemed to sense just what she needed and would lie  quietly on her lap and snuggle up beside her in bed.&nbsp;During his visits,  Brewster would greet all the residents with kisses and tail wags, providing  much needed joy to patients who had lost limbs, suffered strokes or lost the  ability to speak.</p>

  <p> When Dana&rsquo;s mother-in-law passed away, Brewster seemed to  know his job was done.&nbsp;<strong>Dana knew it  was time to find her faithful friend a forever home, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to  let go.</strong>&nbsp;She took him to several adoption events, but he would always  look at her as if to say, &ldquo;Why am I here? I already have a home with you.&rdquo;<br>
    But Brewster still had more lives to change.</p>
  <h2>Meeting the  Perfect Family by Fate</h2>
  <p> Carolyn Cunningham had never been a &ldquo;Chihuahua person&rdquo; until  she rescued Jack, an emaciated Chihuahua found in the middle of an intersection<strong>.&nbsp;Carolyn had only planned to foster  Jack, but when a family showed interest in adopting him, she realized she  couldn&rsquo;t give him up.</strong></p>
  <p>It took many months, but Jack eventually became inseparable  with the Cunningham&rsquo;s other dog, a mixed-breed named Marshall.&nbsp;<strong>When Marshall passed away from cancer July,  2014, the whole family was devastated, including Jack.</strong></p>
  <p><img src="../_images/Stories-2015/Brewster/Brewster visiting hospice friends (2).jpg" width="550" height="733" alt=""/></p>
  <p>&ldquo;After Marshall&rsquo;s passing, Jack did not eat for almost a  week and acted very depressed and moped around for a long period of time  afterwards,&rdquo; Carolyn said.<br>
  When the family felt ready, they started looking for a new  companion for Jack and planned to visit a dog adoption event at a pet store in  Anaheim, California.</p>
  <p> As fate would have it, they ended up at the wrong pet store,  which was also having an adoption event.&nbsp;<strong>Carolyn, who had been researching rescue Chihuahuas online, immediately  recognized Brewster.</strong> The lovable lad melted into her arms and laid his head  against her shoulder, and she was sold.</p>
  <p> Before Brewster could become a permanent member of the  Cunningham family, his foster mom Dana brought him to their home for a  meet-and-greet with Jack. The whole way there, Brewster laid his head on the  console and looked at Dana with his big eyes.&nbsp;<strong>She was heartbroken to give her foster dog away, but she knew it was  time for Brewster to share his therapeutic gifts with another family.</strong></p>

  <p>    As if by instinct, Brewster took it upon himself to help  Jack, sharing a sunbeam with him as they napped and prancing right beside him  on walks.<br>
  Carolyn says there are now doggie toys strewn around her  house, but she wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>
  <p> &ldquo;I now declare I have OCD â€“ Obsessive Chihuahua Disorder,&rdquo;  Carolyn said.</p>
  <p> Carolyn is thinking of having Brewster certified as a  therapy dog.</p>
  <p> Brewster may not be able to fly, but this superhero of a dog  has some pretty amazing powers. He can comfort the sick and heal the  heartbroken. </p>
