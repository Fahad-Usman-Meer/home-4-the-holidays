  <h1>Adopted Dog  Heals Both Man and Cat</h1>
  <p>    In the aftermath of a life-changing vehicular accident in  which he lost half of his left arm, Plato, Missouri, resident Michael, felt led  to get a &ldquo;buddy&rdquo; to help him through.&nbsp;Michael wanted a special companion  that would remain at his side during his transition period, and he chose <a href="http://www.tastc.com/" target="_blank">The Animal Shelter of Texas County (TASTC)</a> to  seek his new canine friend. </p>

  <p>Eager to help him find a match, shelter  representatives paraded one dog after another out of their kennels and to where  he was seated, but after a while, the effort became discouraging.</p>
  <p> &ldquo;I wanted one that would focus on me,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
  <p> Running out of options, TASTC manager Marsha Martin took  what amounted to one last try, and brought out a seven-month-old female Jack  Russell mix named Pepper. It was a long shot at best, because the young mutt  was typically skittish around humans, and not prone to cherishing affection.</p>
  <p> What happened next was the apparent fulfillment of a destiny  shared by a man and a dog. Pepper went right up to Michael, sniffed his injured  arm, and climbed in his lap.<br>
    &ldquo;She ran to me, and hasn&rsquo;t moved away since,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
  <p><img src="../_images/Stories-2015/Pepper and Goober/Pepper and Sir Goober (2).JPG" width="550" height="733" alt=""/></p>
  <p> Pepper now hangs out with her master almost 24/7, remaining  in his lap whenever he sits, and letting him carry her with a special harness  when he moves from place to place. She even growls softly when she feels  someone is too close to his wounded limb.</p>
  <p> The calming effect of Pepper&rsquo;s presence has in a big way  answered a need he felt.&nbsp;During moments when the damaged nerves and muscles  in his arm produce pain and discomfort, she&rsquo;ll lay her head on his wounded arm  and the problems subside.</p>
  <p> Michael considers Pepper a gift from the Lord, and a  continuation of a miraculous scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She was born my dog, and  from the moment we met, she knew exactly what she was supposed to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2>    Fast Forward  Three Months</h2>
  <p> When TASTC made a pleading Facebook post for someone to  foster a kitten, whose leg had to be amputated, Michael&rsquo;s family stepped  up.&nbsp;Michael stated that because God had given him Pepper when he needed  her, he needed to pay it forward and this kitten was in a situation he could  understand. He was adamant that they were fostering only.</p>
  <p><img src="../_images/Stories-2015/Pepper and Goober/Pepper and Sir Goober (3).JPG" width="550" height="413" alt=""/></p>
  <p> When picking up the kitten, they noticed that the front left  leg had been amputated.&nbsp;So just like Michael, this poor kitty had lost his  left arm.Upon arriving home with the nameless kitten, their three-year-old son  immediately dubbed the kitten, &ldquo;Sir Goober Cat.&rdquo; Who could argue with that? He  then proceeded to tell Michael,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you for getting me a cat.&rdquo; They  were now &ldquo;foster failures.&rdquo; Goober was home.</p>
  <p> As Goober was healing, Pepper was there for him just as she  was for Michael. She would lick his wound every evening before bed, and even  now they must play with each other before going to sleep. Michael says, &ldquo;These  two animals are truly angels in our lives.&rdquo;</p>
