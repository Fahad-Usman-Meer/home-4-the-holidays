  <h1>A &ldquo;Tail&rdquo; of Two Kitties</h1>
  <p>Meet Lela!  Lela is a stunning dilute calico kitty that came to Pet Placement  Center&nbsp;with her three litter-mates in October, 2007.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../_images/Stories-2015/Lela and Ren/Lela.jpg" width="289" height="400" alt=""/></p>
  <p>And now meet  Ren! Ren is a handsome tabby boy that has been at Pet Placement  Center&nbsp;since November, 2007.</p>

  <p>Over the  years these two cats formed a strong bond and staff at Pet Placement Center  realized that they truly needed to stay together.&nbsp;Ren was loving and  social but got overlooked because of his age. While Lela was shy, easily  startled, and was intimidated by new people so she hid a lotâ€¦&nbsp;but over the  years she gained confidence because of Ren.&nbsp;She found comfort in him and  you could see them most days laying together and grooming each other.</p>

  <p>After seven  long years of living in the cat colony room at the center, Ren and Lela were  finally adopted into a wonderful home together!&nbsp;Their new family wanted to  adopt a cat pair that had lived at the center awhile and immediately fell in  love with them both. Even Lela showed her approval by gently licking their  hands when they came into to meet them for the first time. Staff was shocked at  how quickly she took to them!</p>

  <p>Now that  they are in their forever home, they are adjusting well and enjoying being able  to explore their new surroundings. They are jumping up on the bed and Lela even  got brave enough to steal ham off of a dinner plate one night!&nbsp;We are so  thankful they are together and can enjoy the love of each other and family  forever!</p>
