  <h1>Always the  Bridesmaid, Never the Bride… Until Home 4 the Holidays!</h1>

  <p> <strong>Charity was rescued  by </strong><a href="http://www.meowfoundation.com/" target="_blank"><strong>MEOW Foundation</strong></a><strong> in  November of 2006, in -30 C weather.&nbsp;She was a young, single, two-year-old  mom with three kittens.</strong> Charity and her kittens found homes quickly,  however, in December, 2008, we received an unfortunate call—<strong>Charity&rsquo;s adopter had become ill, and could  no longer care for her.</strong> Charity was also having a health crisis, and came  back into MEOW&rsquo;s care with a urinary tract infection and diabetes.&nbsp;Charity  went straight into a loving and supportive foster home, who worked hard to help  her lose weight, and her diabetes eventually went into remission.  </p>
  <p> Charity was available for adoption upon her return in 2008,  and patiently waited for someone to take her home. While waiting, Charity&rsquo;s  foster home became terminally ill, and Charity had to say good-bye to her kind  and loving friend. She was moved to another foster home, and unfortunately  regressed, requiring insulin once again. After some tough love by her third  foster home, Charity went back into remission after successfully losing some  excess weight once more.</p>

  <p> Charity continued waiting patiently for her forever family,  she went to Adopt-A-Thons, adoption displays, was promoted in MEOW&rsquo;s monthly  newsletter, and she even had her very own adoption video,&nbsp;but she was  &ldquo;always the bridesmaid, never the bride.&rdquo;</p>

  <p> <strong>Charity moved again  in 2012 to MEOW Foundation&rsquo;s new adoption office, where she became MEOW&rsquo;s  official office cat, greeting those who came to adopt MEOW cats and kittens.</strong> Charity was still greeting MEOW&rsquo;s adoption office visitors when the Blue  Buffalo Home 4 the Holidays adoption drive was launched at the beginning of  October, 2013.</p>

  <p> To give Charity another adoption push, we decided she would  be MEOW&rsquo;s 2013 Home 4 the Holidays poster cat<strong>. Out of the blue, on November 18, we received an adoption application  for Charity.&nbsp;The lady interested in Charity came to MEOW&rsquo;s Adoption Centre  on November 22, to visit Charity, and to talk more about her dietary needs.</strong> Then one hour later, Charity was on her way home. Finally!</p>
  <p> Charity spent five years with MEOW waiting and hoping  someone would see past her &ldquo;big boned&rdquo; physique and appreciate her loving,  playful nature. Charity has hit the jack pot and MEOW Foundation&rsquo;s staff and  volunteers couldn&rsquo;t be happier!</p>
