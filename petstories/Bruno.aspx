  <h1>Adopted Dog  Helps New Owner with PTSD</h1>
  <p><img src="../_images/Stories-2015/Bruno/Chris and Bruno1.jpg" width="550" height="413" alt=""/></p>
  <p>    Our goal at <a href="http://www.richardsonrescue.org/">Richardson  Rescue</a> is to bring together pets and people to form a family. We believe  that a pet should be a lifelong companion, and our adoption process is designed  to match pets to families. Many of our pets choose their families and are &ldquo;just  meant to be.&rdquo; This was the case with Bruno.</p>
  <p> <strong>Bruno, a two-year-old  Labrador Retriever mix came to us shortly after having one of his front legs  amputated as a result of an old gunshot wound.</strong> Bruno was a happy, playful,  easy-going guy who loved life, and never gave his missing leg a second thought!  He quickly became a staff favorite. Overlooked by adopters, Bruno knew that  someday, he would meet someone who needed him as much as he needed them. That  day came when Bruno met Chris.</p>
  <p> Chris, an Army Veteran who proudly served in the 2nd Infantry  in Korea, had recently lost his beloved Rottie of fifteen years; Brandy. <strong>For Chris, his pets represent much more  than companionship. Chris suffers from PTSD and says his dogs are a comfort to  him.</strong> They represent security, friendship, and most of all, their presence  in his life helps relieve stress and anxiety. </p>
  <p> Chris and his Golden Retriever, Oscar, were in search of a  new companion to fill the hole they each had in their hearts from the loss of  Brandy. Their new companion would need to be very special, and need them as  much as they needed him. On that beautiful August day, they would meet Bruno.</p>
  <h2> Bruno  Becomes a True Forever Friend</h2>

  <p>    When Chris and Oscar arrived at the Rescue, Bruno was  waiting in the play area. <strong>As they  entered and approached Bruno, he ran up to them and greeted him with his  trademark smile, and looked at Chris as if to say, &ldquo;Take me home Dad, I&rsquo;m  ready.&rdquo;</strong> Chris and Oscar had found their new companion!</p>
  <p> <strong>Chris feels that many  other Veterans would benefit from dog ownership as a means of dealing with  PTSD.</strong> He says having a dog can help relieve stress, depression, anxiety,  and provides a sense of security, especially at night. As a result of this  heartwarming adoption, we hope to inspire others to consider adopting a pet to  relieve symptoms, of not only PTSD, but also other conditions. Richardson  Rescue is working to enact a program, Pets for Vets, which will match dogs from  our Rescue with Veterans. Seeing them together, and how Bruno seems to sense  Chris&rsquo; needs, it truly one of the joys of Rescue.</p>
