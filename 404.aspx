<h1 class="grn_ttl_blg">This year...1.5-Million is the goal...but the sky's the limit!<br></h1>
<p><img src="../_images/events/h4th/Little boy holding orange cat.jpg" alt="h4th" width="275" height="200" align="right" />The 1,363,638 orphan pets that found their new families during the    11th annual  Home 4 the Holidays (H4TH) pet adoption drive were a great    start, but there's still work to be done. The goal of H4TH 2010 is 1.5-million    orphan pet adoptions worldwide. It's not too late to enroll and it's    never too late to adopt your new best friend! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>H4TH creator Mike Arms, President of Helen    Woodward Animal Center, says, &quot;H4TH began in    1999 with 14 animal shelters in San Diego, California. Since then H4TH has become    the largest pet adoption drive in history, finding families for more than    4.6-million orphan pets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arms    says the shelter workers and rescue volunteers have made H4TH successful. Many    shelters have ended euthanasia during H4TH. That's a tremendous    holiday gift for anyone dedicated to saving animals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's    not too late to help! Animal shelters and pet rescue groups can still    register for the 12th annual H4TH campaign. And families in search of new    pets can make a choice that saves a life when they opt to adopt. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What    better gift can there be during the holiday season than to save the life of    an orphan?</p>
