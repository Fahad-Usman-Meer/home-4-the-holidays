  <h1><strong>Pink&rsquo;s Story</strong></h1>
  <p>    From  <a href="http://www.seattleareafelinerescue.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Area Feline Rescue</a>  in Seattle, Washington </p>

  <p><strong>Pink used to live on her own, hiding under the  vehicles in an old car lot.</strong> There, she cared for herself and her litter of  seven kittens. Each day, she ventured out cautiously to find food and then  hurried back to care for her babies. <strong>When  a Good Samaritan set up a feeding station, she was too frightened to make  friends or be touched.</strong></p>

  <p>With  patience, Pink became more trusting. The Good Samaritan stayed patient, coaxing  Pink with kibble and reassurance, until at last, she let herself be picked up  and put into a crate.</p>

  <p>Six of  her kittens were easy to find, but the seventh, a black kitty, got scared and  hid. <strong>When this little one realized that  her mom and brothers and sisters were gone, she came out of hiding and began to  cry.</strong> The rescuer found her and reunited the relieved kitten with her  family. </p>
  <p>Pink  and her seven babies came to Seattle Area Feline Rescue, where they got the TLC  they needed to grow strong and healthy. At the rescue, the kittens turned into  curious, playful fluffballs, and each of them found loving homes very quickly. </p>
  <p><strong>Pink was a different story, still shy from her time  on the streets.</strong> She found the rescue environment overwhelming, so  she went into a foster home for more care. At first, she thought her foster  home was scary, too, and spent her time hiding behind the shower curtain.</p>

  <p>With  more time and patience, Pink began to let go of her survival mode. <strong>She chirped to her foster mom, became an  expert &ldquo;biscuit maker&rdquo; and sought out pets.</strong> She even cautiously explored  what being a lap kitty might be like, starting by putting just her paws in her  foster mom&rsquo;s lap. </p>
  <p>Toys  were a revelation: at first they made Pink nervous – until she discovered  ping-pong balls. Then toys were her new favorite thing in the world! </p>
  <p>Once  Pink had decided that humans could be trusted, and even loved, she was ready to  come back to the rescue and find a forever home. She won the heart of an  adopter who took her home to join the family. Now she has a home of her very  own – instead of fear, her life is filled with love and comfort! </p>
  <p><strong>Even a kitty used to living outdoors and fending  for herself can become a loving family pet.</strong> Pink's adopter reports,  &quot;She is the best addition to my family... I love her!&quot; </p>
