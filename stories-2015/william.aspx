  <h1><strong>William&rsquo;s Story</strong></h1>
  <p>    From  <a href="http://www.ruffloverescue.com/" target="_blank">Ruff Love Rescue</a>  in  Thomasville, North Carolina</p>

  <p>My  story is about my best friend who came into our family from Ruff Love Rescue in  Thomasville, NC.</p>
  <p>When  we first looked into adopting a dog, I was skeptical. Then my wife showed me  the picture of William and I was done. <strong>There  he was, this Labrador-mastiff mix with three legs and the most adorable face, and  I knew I wanted him to be part of our family.</strong></p>
  <p>When  we adopted William, one of the volunteers with Ruff Love Rescue took my wife to  the side and told his heartbreaking story of the abuse. When William came to  the rescue, he had double cherry eye, abscessed teeth, was full of parasites,  heartworm positive and had to have his leg amputated. However, with a lot of  help and love from a bunch of people, he has a second chance at the life he  deserves. </p>
  <p><strong>In the following weeks as we got to know William, I was amazed  at how his past didn't affect his future, and no matter what he endured before,  all that mattered to him is the here and now.</strong> William taught me,  through his life, no matter what we go through or where we come from, the past  is just that, the past.</p>

  <p>William  has overcome overwhelming odds and despite that, he is an amazing dog and I  couldn't imagine my life without him. Ruff Love Rescue went above and beyond  what most would have done. For everything they have done for William, I could  never begin to give them the thanks that they deserve. <strong>Now, my wife and I volunteer and foster so we can help other animals  get a second chance and find their forever home.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Before William joined our family, he was the poster dog  for Ruff Love and had been with them for over two years, never even had an  application submitted for him.</strong> Passed over time after time, William is the epitome of  Ruff Love Rescue, rescuing dogs others wouldn&rsquo;t bother to help. They give them  a second chance at a life they deserve.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Since  coming into our family, William has learned so much and given us so much love.  I am constantly amazed at how, from his past to the time spent at the rescue,  he was just waiting for the place he was meant to be, and I am so thankful his  place was with our family. Since William came into our lives, we started  fostering for Ruff Love, and <strong>William is  a role model for our fosters. It feels like he knows that our fosters are on  their journey to their forever home.</strong> <strong>He  has slept beside fosters the first couple nights in our home, showed one how to  ring the bell at the door to go out and even snuggled and comforted one foster  who lost her sister.</strong> William has changed our lives for good just like Ruff  Love changed his. William proves &ldquo;pay it forward&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just for people.</p>
