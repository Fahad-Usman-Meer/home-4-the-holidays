  On Friday,  October 30, 2015, I received a call at 5 p.m. from a frantic UPS driver.&nbsp;<strong>He had found an orange kitten barely alive  in a parking lot with two other orange kittens.</strong>&nbsp;He told me the  location and that someone who worked at the business he was delivering to took  the sick cat home.&nbsp;I was in the middle of asking him if he had the contact  information of the person who took the cat home when my phone  died!&nbsp;Unfortunately, the UPS driver called from an unknown number, so I  couldn't call him back. (I wanted to go get the kitten in case this Good  Samaritan didn't quite know what to do with an injured animal.)</p>
  <p>    About 10  minutes later, I walked outside to get in my car to head to the location, when  a UPS truck pulled up at my neighbor's to deliver a package.&nbsp;<strong>I shouted to him &quot;Did you just call  someone about an injured cat?&quot; He replied, &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;He had the  phone number of the gentleman who took the cat home, and I was able to make  contact and headed over to his house to pick up the cat. What are the chances  of that?&nbsp;<strong>Definitely divine  intervention!&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>    When I first  saw the kitten, I noticed he was very lethargic, dehydrated, mildly anemic and  skinny.&nbsp;I immediately took him to our local 24/7 emergency clinic,  Emergency Pet Hospital of Collier County in Naples, Florida.&nbsp;The doctor  felt a foreign body during a pelvic exam and confirmed with X-rays there was  something lodged in his intestines.&nbsp;We left him there for IV fluids to see  if rehydrating could potentially move the body out of the intestines, no  luck.&nbsp;The next day they went in and surgically removed a WHOLE ALMOND!&nbsp;<strong>This poor little guy was so hungry he must  have been eating anything he could find.&nbsp;</strong>The almond was stuck in his  intestines and was causing him all kinds of problems.&nbsp;Thanks to  fundraising efforts on Facebook and a group of very generous donors, we were  able to cover the very large nut.&nbsp;He bounced back almost instantly, and we  picked him up that Monday.&nbsp;Monday evening, I received a message from a  lovely young girl named Franki; she was his vet tech all weekend and had  assisted in his surgery.&nbsp;She had fallen in love with him and wanted to  give him a forever home!&nbsp;We were so excited! Who better to adopt him than  her?!&nbsp;<strong>They went home together  yesterday, and of course, his name is now Almond Joy!</strong></p>
