  <h1><strong>Brownie&rsquo;s Story</strong></h1>
  <p>    From <a href="http://awos.petfinder.com/shelters/mldhs.html" target="_blank">Meadow Lake  and District Humane Society</a>   in Saskatchewan, Canada</p>

  In the spring of 2015, a mixed breed puppy named Brownie was found by a  community nurse in a small Northern Saskatchewan town.&nbsp;  </p>

  <p>    Despite a mild case of mange, Brownie quickly recovered while in foster care  with her rescuer.&nbsp; While the Meadow Lake and District Humane Society  (MLDHS) searched for a forever home, Brownie waited patiently for a few weeks  until some former MLDHS adopters came looking for a buddy for the MLDHS dog  they had adopted a few years previous.  They  decided to adopt her, named her Brownie, and within the month, took her to  their vet for her scheduled spay surgery.  </p>
  <p><strong>During that appointment, Brownie  was diagnosed with Enamel Hypolasia, an illness that hinders the growth of enamel  on a puppy&rsquo;s permanent teeth during development.</strong>  The  treatment is expensive and requires life-long maintenance.  At that time, Brownie&rsquo;s options were to have  all her teeth removed or suffer with mouth and jaw pain for the rest of her  life.  The adoptive family felt they  couldn&rsquo;t have such a young, sweet dog live her whole life with no teeth and  obviously they couldn&rsquo;t let her live in severe pain, <strong>so they made the difficult decision to return her to MLDHS in May so  that the board of directors could decide, as a group, how to provide a positive  outcome for Brownie. <br>
    </strong><br>
    Soon after, an MLDHS volunteer used her connections as a veterinary technician  to get in touch with a veterinary dentist who only comes to Saskatchewan  bi-annually.&nbsp; In order to determine eligibility for enamel repair surgery,  front-to-back pictures of Brownie&rsquo;s teeth needed to be submitted to this  veterinary specialist.&nbsp; Very dedicated volunteers worked together to  photograph Brownie&rsquo;s entire mouth while she did her best to be a sweet and cooperative  little girl, despite the discomfort of the ordeal.  </p>

  <p>    After a review of the images, the vet dentist determined that Brownie was indeed  a candidate for surgery, despite the fact that his surgical rotation wouldn&rsquo;t  bring him back to Saskatchewan for several months.  <strong>The  executive of MLDHS made a board decision to give Brownie the second chance she  deserved and committed to cover the estimated $2,000 cost of the surgery.</strong>  <strong>It was  then that MLDHS approached Diane, who had previously fostered a couple of dogs  on a short term basis, with the hopes that Brownie wouldn&rsquo;t have to spend her  pre-surgery wait living at the animal shelter.</strong>&nbsp; Diane thankfully  agreed to make Brownie&rsquo;s five-month wait a relaxing and happy one in a real  home environment.<br>
  <br>
    Brownie enjoyed life in Diane&rsquo;s home, and they quickly became great pals.  Brownie made herself right at home; she always  rode shotgun on the many road trips with Diane and provided great entertainment  with her quirky way of running at full speed only, hopping along like a rabbit.&nbsp;  She was a constant bed hog and had an excellent energy level and personality  that was compatible with Diane&rsquo;s senior dog, Shundy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>It was in July that Diane&rsquo;s life took a  devastating turn as her only child was killed in a tragic motorcycle accident.</strong>&nbsp;  Brownie became a great comfort to Diane during the months of heartbreaking  grief that followed.&nbsp; Eventually, Brownie&rsquo;s October dental surgery date  arrived and the procedure was greatly successful.&nbsp; Diane couldn&rsquo;t wait to  have Brownie back with her that very same night, even though it was midnight by  the time she arrived home to Meadow Lake.  </p>

  <p>    Diane took on the intensive treatment and after-care for Brownie in the weeks  following her surgery, and Brownie proved to be a very cooperative and  trouble-free patient.&nbsp; Once treatment was complete, it became time to once  again post Brownie as available for adoption.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>After the entire ordeal and months of  bonding, Diane came to realize she couldn&rsquo;t possibly part with her &ldquo;little  trinket&rdquo; who had been such an important part of her life and grieving process.</strong>&nbsp;  Diane signed the adoption papers and on November 23, 2015, Brownie became a  permanent member of the home she had shared over the past several months.<br>
    <br>
    MLDHS contacted the nurse who originally rescued Brownie to tell her that  Brownie had recovered and had been re-adopted.  The nurse was delighted to hear the news and  mentioned that she had originally named the sweet, mangy, little puppy &ldquo;Angel.&rdquo;  &nbsp;<strong>It was then that everything came  together, and we all realized that Brownie must have been &ldquo;sent&rdquo; to Diane as  her own precious angel and that this adoption was meant to be all along! &nbsp;</strong></p>
