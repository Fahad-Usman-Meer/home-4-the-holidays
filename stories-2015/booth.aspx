  <h1><strong>Booth&rsquo;s  Story</strong></h1>
  <p>    From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElizabethtonCarterCountyAnimalShelter/" target="_blank">Elizabethton Carter County  Animal Shelter</a>  in Elizabethton, Tennessee </p>
  <p><img src="../_images/Stories-2016/4 - Booth/Boothe - Heartwarming Story Contest-1.jpg" width="540" height="764" alt=""/></p>
  <p>We wanted to share Booth the  wonder dog's happy ending with everyone. <strong>There  was a very nice man who came to the shelter one day, and when we asked how we  could help him, he simply said, &quot;I need a friend.&quot; </strong>He was a war veteran  who had obviously seen a LOT of life. He lived alone. No pets. No family. You  could just tell he would be perfect for an adoption candidate. Not in the  wealthy sense, but in all the love and commitment it takes to be a great pet dad.  Our awesome trustees took him back, and they searched for the perfect dog. They  can match people to pets with the best of them and know all of our animals&rsquo;  personalities.<br>
    <br>
    They all said it at the same time: &quot;Booth!&rdquo; He's a two-year-old Great  Dane/pit bull mix, loyal, lovable, housebroken and ready to go. The veteran  smiled from ear to ear, and Booth enthusiastically gave his paw of approval on  his new dad. He's been a shelter favorite since he came to us, but was always  passed over for one reason or another.<br>
  <br>
    The man said he was sorry, but he didn't get paid for a few days and only came to  look. His eyes were downcast, and he mumbled he really &ldquo;wished he could take  Booth home now.&rdquo; He never expected to find the perfect dog on his first trip  out. <strong>Most adoptions run $55. That was a  lot more than the few dollars the vet had in his pocket.</strong> They all returned  to the window to see if there was anything we could do. </p>
  <p>Booth was an owner surrender who,  lo and behold, had already been vetted and microchipped before he came to us by  the previous owner. That meant his adoption cost was just $10! We love our  veterans, and the companionship of an animal can mean all the difference to  them. To thank them for their sacrifice and service to this great country of  ours, we waive the $10 adoption fee with a military I.D. <strong>That meant Booth&rsquo;s adoption for this man was free.</strong><br>
    <br>
<strong>We have never seen a happier human and  dog. We all teared up, as this beautiful man just sat in his car with Booth  riding shotgun, marveling at his new best friend, hugging him around the neck,  gently crying into his fur.</strong> This, folks, is why we do this. This is what  makes it all worthwhile.</p> <div style="float:right"><a href="../essay_contest.aspx">Back to Voting</a></div></asp:content>
