  <p>    Hi. My name is Boone. I want to tell  my story of how JUST a shelter dog can change someone&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;I am from  LaGrange, Indiana, where I was in ARK Animal Shelter for two and a half months.  My brother, Banjo, and I both ended up in the shelter together. However, I was  lucky enough to be pulled out of the shelter by the nice people of Refurbished  Pets of Southern Michigan (RPSM.)&nbsp;<strong>RPSM  took me to the Coldwater, Michigan men&rsquo;s prison where I was incarcerated for 10  weeks with my inmate trainers through the Prison Companionship Program.</strong> I  lived with my two trainers in the prison. Even though the nice people at the  shelter loved me and did their best, I was so excited to be around people all  day long and to have my very own bed to sleep in!&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p>    My trainers taught me so many things.  I learned to sit, stay, walk nicely on a leash and many other basic manners. I  also learned how to pull doors open, stabilize someone while walking and pick  things up on command. These last commands will be used on a daily basis for my  new best friend and owner. <strong>My owner has  cerebral palsy, and I am his service dog.</strong> I got to go home with him on  Friday, December 18, 2015.&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t wait to show him all that I have  learned and to have an important purpose in life.&nbsp;It just show what JUST a  shelter dog can do!</p> <div style="float:right"><a href="../essay_contest.aspx">Back to Voting</a></div></asp:content>
