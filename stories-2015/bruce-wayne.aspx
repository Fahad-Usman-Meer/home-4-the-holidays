  <p>    Bruce Wayne. The superhero who  overcame the odds. That&rsquo;s how our Bruce Wayne got his name. This amazing dog  overcame all the odds stacked against him. </p>
  <p>    It was early in August 2015 when  we got a call about an owned dog in Flint, Michigan, who was in need of  intervention. The owner had a one-year-old pit bull chained outside with no  shelter, food or water. He was incredibly emaciated. <strong>Even the vet only gave him a three percent chance of survival.</strong> He  had been intentionally starved for over six months and the damage was severe,  almost deadly.</p>

  <p><strong>When taken to the first veterinarian, they  said the estimate to save him was going to be $15,000 and that was only if he  managed to survive the first blood transfusion.</strong> Once he was stable, we transported him to  our emergency veterinarian.</p>
  <p>    Though our vet was more  optimistic about his recovery, his survival was still up in the air. <strong>He required several blood transfusions and  was a strong candidate for a feeding tube.</strong> Slowly but surely though, Bruce  Wayne started to recover. He spent quite some time receiving round-the-clock  care and was finally released into a medical foster home. </p>

  <p>    This is where the magic happened. <strong>He went from a frail, emaciated dog, to  a handsome, lovable guy.</strong> As the weeks went along, Bruce Wayne began to  play, he began to go for short walks, he started to feel better. It took a  month, but he was finally healthy enough to get neutered. It took two months  for Bruce Wayne to have enough energy to start playing with other dogs in his  yard.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>    After three months, Bruce Wayne  was healthy and ready to find a home of his very own. And it didn&rsquo;t take long  either. A family who had been following his story on Facebook came to an  adoption event to meet him. <strong>They took  him home, and there was no surprise when the called to say they are in love with  the new member of their family.</strong> He is doing so well in his new home. Every  day, Bruce Wayne amazes his new family with his captivating personality and  willingness to forgive. He has taught all of us that the past is the past, and  our future only lays ahead of us.</p>
  <p>    Bruce Wayne was adopted on October 15, 2015 to  an amazing home. The family also stepped up to foster another one of our dogs  in need. We hope that story has just as happy of an ending!</p>
