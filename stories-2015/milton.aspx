  <h1><strong>Milton&rsquo;s  Story</strong></h1>
  <p>    From <a href="http://wagoninn.rescuegroups.org/" target="_blank">Wag On Inn Rescue</a>  in Oakhurst, New Jersey</p>

  <p>    Milton was found as a stray.  The couple who found him brought him to their  local vet, who said Milton had mange and that his skin was badly infected. The  vet suggested the couple either euthanize Milton or turn him in to the shelter.  The couple got scared when they heard this and surrendered him to the shelter  right away. <strong>What a poor stroke of luck. First, Milton is rescued from  neglect with badly infected mange, and then due to his illness, he is  &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo; as a pet. </strong>This little guy was only several weeks old and yet had  suffered so much already.  </p>
  <p>    One of the shelter&rsquo;s regular foster families  happened to be there the day Milton arrived. His soon-to-be foster mom, Wanda,  said, &ldquo;The day I first saw Milton was  when he was brought in to the shelter. <strong>He  felt so bad he just slept.</strong> That's when I knew I wanted him. I got him the  next day after he'd been to the vet.&rdquo;  </p>

  <p>    Wanda and her family fostered  Milton for four weeks in North Carolina. They helped clear his skin infection  and got rid of his fever, and his hair quickly started growing back. Milton&rsquo;s  foster family noticed he loved big dogs from the start. <strong>So once he was ready to come north to Wag On Inn Rescue in New Jersey,  a special request for big-dog siblings was put on Milton&rsquo;s wish list for his  new home. </strong></p>
  <p>    Milton quickly settled into his  new foster home in New Jersey. His foster family said what a great dog he was – cuddly, fun and friendly to humans and dogs! As  Milton continued to improve and regain his &ldquo;good looks,&rdquo; his wonderful  personality was shining through.  <strong>He  adored all the dogs in his foster home, but had a special friendship with a  very shy foster pup who was about his same age. Milton&rsquo;s outgoing personality  and confidence gave Rico more courage, and soon both were greeting everyone.</strong>  </p>
  <p>    It only took a few weeks for the perfect  family and forever home to come along for Milton.  And remember that special wish list Milton  had? His New Jersey foster mom Debbie said, &ldquo;I LOVE his new family! Two nice  BIG black dogs, two teens who are lovely, and a mom and a dad.&nbsp;A nice yard  and regular trips to a second home by the lake. I was sad to see him go, but he  will have a wonderful life!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Milton&rsquo;s story proves that sometimes the best  things don&rsquo;t come in the prettiest packages, and all life is precious.</strong> Thankfully, some kind rescue staff saw through Milton&rsquo;s sickly exterior  and gave him the chance at the good life he truly deserved! </p>
