  <h1><strong>Manny and Ray&rsquo;s Story </strong></h1>
  <p>    From<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.easelnj.org/cms/index.php" target="_blank">EASEL  Animal Rescue League</a> () in Ewing, New Jersey</p>
  <p><img src="../_images/Stories-2016/8 - Manny and Ray/Manny and Ray - Heartwarming Story Contest-1.jpg" width="500" height="750" alt=""/></p>
  <p>    This is a story of humans  and cats who are not deterred by difficulties and came together to care for  each other.</p>
  <p>    On a hot August day in  Hamilton Township, NJ, Animal Control got a call about some free-roaming cats  in an apartment complex. They reached out to EASEL Animal Rescue League, which  manages the no-kill shelter in neighboring Ewing and works with Trap, Neuter,  Return (TNR) volunteers throughout Mercer County and environs.</p>
  <p>    With EASEL covering her  costs, experienced rescuer Jamie S. took on the task, dealing with a community  of more than 20 cats in the heat of summer. She trapped a mother cat and four  kittens who were living in an insulated crawl space in the basement of one of  the buildings. They were emaciated with severe upper respiratory illnesses. <strong>The worst off was a little tuxedo kitten  named Ray, who also had eye infections.&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><img src="../_images/Stories-2016/8 - Manny and Ray/Manny and Ray - Heartwarming Story Contest-3.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt=""/></p>
  <p>    Across town, another cat  colony had produced another dozen kittens in a backyard. Besides treating and  fixing the adults, the TNR project found the little ones also were underweight  and had upper respiratory infections and ringworm. When both waves of kittens  arrived at EASEL, Dr. Johnson, who provides a deep discount for the  organization, promptly responded with veterinary care. </p>
  <p>    Many of the kittens quickly  improved, but little Ray from the first litter was a particular challenge. <strong>Dr. Johnson quickly determined that his  right eye could not be saved. </strong>His left eye was in bad shape, but the vet  determined to try courses of topical and oral antibiotics. Unfortunately, they  did not work, and 6 weeks later, she removed that eye. </p>
  <p>    But in his months at the  veterinary practice, Ray had become a staff favorite. <strong>His friendly personality came through his surgeries intact, and even  blind, he expertly navigated his environment. </strong>Unlike many cats, he quickly  adopted his name, coming when called.</p>
  <p>    Meanwhile, the second  litter of kittens were made available for adoption. Some found homes quickly. <strong>But one little black kitten, named  Manicotti, lingered. </strong>Although friendly and playful, he was just basic black  with no other markings to distinguish him. Visitors passed him by, some commenting  that they didn't want a black cat.</p>

  <p>    Two months after these TNR  projects, Melissa F. was forced to say goodbye to her long-time feline  companion. A handsome black cat, Wiggi had been at her side through major life  events for almost 14 years. </p>
  <p>    A lifelong cat lover,  Melissa knew she would find room in her heart for another. <strong>But she also wanted to accommodate her daughter Azaliah , 8, who is  deaf and suffers neurological problems, including cerebral palsy.</strong> Although  her issues are so mild in their expression as to be scarcely noticeable, Azaliah  often is reluctant to interact with animals.</p>
  <p>    From co-workers who are EASEL  volunteers, Melissa heard tales of the many animals available in that busy  season at the shelter. She was particularly sympathetic to Ray's travails and  undeterred by his blindness.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;I've worked with  children who are blind,&quot; she said. </p>
  <p><img src="../_images/Stories-2016/8 - Manny and Ray/Manny and Ray - Heartwarming Story Contest-4.jpg" width="500" height="750" alt=""/></p>
  <p>    When Ray was finally out of  quarantine, she brought her daughter, Azaliah, to the shelter to have a look at  him. That important meeting was a success.</p>
  <p>&quot;She's really taken to  Ray,&quot; Melissa said. &quot;He came over, right up to her and introduced  himself, and they hit it off from the start.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I was considering  adopting two this time, because I thought having a companion would be good for  Ray,&quot; she said.</p>
  <p>    As a believer that  &quot;black cats are the best!&quot;, Melissa herself could not overlook  Manicotti, still in need of a home. She agreed to adopt him as well, nicknamed  Manny as less of a mouthful. <strong>He joined  the family a week before Ray, in order to learn the lay of the land so he could  guide his new furbrother.</strong></p>
  <p>    Although safe in a loving  home, little Manny was at a loss. For the first time in his short life, he was  not surrounded by other cats. That changed when Ray arrived. Both kittens were thrilled  to have one another, Melissa said. </p>
  <p><strong>And just as he has throughout his story, Ray doesn't need much  help finding his way.</strong> </p>
  <p>&quot;I thought that Manny  could lead him around, but about the only thing he leads him to are things like  the blinds,&quot; Melissa said. &quot;When he bats them, Ray hears the sound  and comes running to see what there is to play with.&quot;</p>
  <p>    Her experience adopting  &quot;has been better than I could have hoped for,&quot; she said. Ray and  Manny agree. <strong>&quot;Those two are the  best of friends,&quot; she said.</strong><br>
    Nichole M, an instructor at the Marie H.  Katzenbach School for the Deaf, describes Azaliah as &quot;an amazing little  girl who overcomes many challenges in her life every day.&quot; She echoes  Melissa&rsquo;s comment that Azaliah has had &quot;no interest in cats,&quot; but  added that has changed with Ray.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>&quot;Ray  is&nbsp;<em>her&nbsp;</em>cat; it is as if Ray senses  Azaliah's disabilities and relates more to her than to her mother,&quot; she said.</strong> &quot;Often Ray will be found lying in Azaliah's  lap.&nbsp;Ray and&nbsp;Azaliah have now become the best of friends.&quot;Â  </p>
  <p>    It shouldn&rsquo;t really be a  surprise, look at the expression of utter joy on her face the day she got to  bring him home! </p>
