  <p>    Pirate came  to our rescue in 2009 as a young adult who was owner-relinquished due to the  bad health of an elderly gentleman. Pirate had not had a great life but was not  abused, just neglected before he came to us. He was a beautiful merle Collie  but just wasn't very people-friendly.&nbsp;He was accepting of our staff  because he knew them and we all took care of him, but when adopters would  visit, he was standoffish and shy. <strong>Seven  long years passed and although he had a good life with a playmate, and of  course good food and shelter, we never gave up on finding him the right home. </strong></p>
  <p>    That day  came this October with an inquiry from a retired military nurse and Vietnam  vet.&nbsp;Gerrie drove about three hours to meet Pirate with her female Collie,  Carrie, in hopes he would be the right dog for their family.&nbsp;She and her  husband were both retired military officers and always had pets but had  recently lost two of their three beloved dogs.&nbsp;<strong>We, of course, told her about Pirate's shyness, but we always say most  dogs will blossom when they learn to trust and become part of a family.</strong>&nbsp;She  arrived and was a little hesitant at first with his shyness, but he walked well  on a leash and did fine with Carrie. So with our encouragement, she took him  home. Well, blossom he did!</p>

  <p>    Here is a  journal of the first few weeks for Pirate (now aptly named Lucky):</p>
  <p><em>Home at last.&nbsp;Not a peep out of Pirate  the whole time.&nbsp;Carrie hopped back and checked on him along the  way.&nbsp;I thought I'd never coax him out of the crate... even with hot  dogs!&nbsp;He is now in the backyard checking how many trees need to be wet  on.&nbsp;The house required a serious smell over. The hubby thinks he needs to  be named Lucky.&nbsp; </em></p>
  <p><em>Lucky has continued his completely  gentlemanly behavior.&nbsp;He has not even tried to challenge Miss Carrie for  the senior dog position, just gently lets her do whatever she chooses.&nbsp;He  is beginning to show a bit more vigor, steps more lively, even jumped off the  deck last night when Carrie barked that she had heard something. (Squirrel?  Possum? Raccoon? Who knows?)â€‹&nbsp;Oddly, he has yet to make a single  sound...not a bark, whine or whimper.&nbsp;Surely in his misty history someone  has not meddled with his vocal cords?&nbsp;I think I will ask Travis, my vet,  to check that when he works on his teeth under anesthesia Thursday.&nbsp; More  as the situation develops...</em></p>
  <p><em>Prayers are being said right now&nbsp;while  under anesthesia, and we'll keep 'em going for our boy!&nbsp;Yes, his vocal  chords were damaged&nbsp;long ago and cannot be repaired.&nbsp; I apologize if  my report saddened you.&nbsp;You kept him going and put him on the website  until I got there with two dog-sized holes in my heart to fill.&nbsp;<strong>He is a Johnson now, and no one will ever  hurt or neglect him again.&nbsp;</strong>I really had expected him to at least have  intestinal parasites to be dealt with, being in an outdoor run. You run a really  clean operation up there.&nbsp;We are grateful and wish you and all your other  charges the very best.&nbsp;Lucky is beginning to get the idea of  &quot;sit&rdquo;&nbsp;and tends to stay there until I ask him to do something  else...what a pleasure!&nbsp; </em></p>
  <p><em>Sending you two pictures of &quot;my  guys.&rdquo;&nbsp;Do you think this pooch has made himself sufficiently at  home?&nbsp;We had five grandkids (ages toddler, Aggie Junior to 3rd grader)  here Friday, and I was worried it would be too much for him as he is shy with  strangers.&nbsp;<strong>No worries, he was all  entwined with the kids all day.&nbsp;We love this Lucky boy and think we are  truly the lucky ones.</strong>&nbsp;Do have a blessed Christmas, Gerrie</em></p>
