 <p>    From <a href="http://www.blountcountyhumanesociety.org/" target="_blank">Blount  County Humane Society</a>  in Maryville, Tennesee  </p>

  <p><strong>Back in August, gray tabby kittens  Abbott and Costello were discovered covered in &ldquo;Good Stuff,&rdquo; foam in a spray  bottle used for insulation.</strong> BCHS shared the jaw-dropping story on their Facebook page: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;These two kittens were found Friday night by a Good  Samaritan on the road behind K-Mart in Alcoa about 9:30 p.m. They were covered  in a product called Good Stuff used to insulate gaps around windows and doors.  We believe [the kittens] were set at this location by someone after [that  person] put this product on the kittens. <strong>As  you can see, one kitten had his head completely covered; he was unable to see  and was found in the middle of the road going in circles. The other kitten was  immobile because he was stuck inside a Pampers diaper box on the side of the  road.&rdquo;</strong></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both kittens were brought to Midland Pet Emergency  Center and were treated by the dedicated staff there and by some of our BCHS  volunteers. We were called by Midland Pet Emergency to start the investigation  that will hopefully lead to a prosecution of the individuals responsible for  this act of crueltyâ€¦&rdquo;</p>

  <p>    According to <a href="http://wate.com/2015/08/16/2-kittens-found-covered-in-sticky-goo-investigator-looking-for-person-responsible/" target="_blank">WATE TV 6</a>, <strong>it took technicians 3 hours to  painstakingly remove the sticky substance from the kittens.</strong> They shaved off  two full bags of fur. </p>

  <p>    The kittens&rsquo; story garnered much publicity and  outraged the community. <em>How could someone  be so cruel? </em>Thousands of people shared their story on Facebook, which led  to many much-needed donations for the kittens&rsquo; care. </p>
  <p>    Staff and volunteers at BCHS cared the kittens,  nicknamed the Foam Kitties, until October 11, 2015, when Abbott and Costello  finally got their happy ending. <br>
    From BCHS: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A wonderful couple felt their hearts  break when they read their story. They visited them a couple of times and then  decided to make these babies their own. <strong>There  was an instant connection between the boys and mom and dad.</strong> Abbott and  Costello cannot get enough loving from mom and dad. Happy life boys!! We wait  for updates on how happy you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>    To date, no arrests have been made.  It&rsquo;s easy to lose faith when you see the cruelty of which human beings are  capable. But the real &ldquo;good stuff&rdquo; in this story isn&rsquo;t the foam insulation  sprayed on the kittens. It&rsquo;s the Good Samaritan who rescued them, the medical  staff who saved them, the volunteers who cared for them, the donors who  supported them and the couple who will love them forever. </p>
