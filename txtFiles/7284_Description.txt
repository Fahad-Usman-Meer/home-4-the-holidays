<p><strong>Acadiana Humane Society is a non-profit no-kill animal rescue. We rescue cats, dogs, rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs,&nbsp;chinchillas, and other small animals. These animals are housed in foster homes around Acadiana. Construction on our hurricane safe shelter in Sunset, Louisiana has halted due to lack of funding. We&nbsp;are currently raising funds to complete this project. Once the animals are fully vetted we find them forever homes. We hold adoption events on most Saturdays at either of the Lafayette Petco stores. Please check our Facebook page and website for the current locations and times.</strong></p>
