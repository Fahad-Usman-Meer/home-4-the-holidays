Young at Heart Pet Rescue is Chicagoland's only rescue organization dedicated to the rescue and rehoming of senior dogs and cats. Founded in 2005, over 400 senior dogs and cats with an average age of 9.5 years old have found loving homes through our organization. Our mission is to rescue and rehome senior dogs and cats, reduce the euthanasia rate for older, adoptable pets in IL, and to educate the public on the benefits of adopting an older pet. Older pets deserve a second chance, too!
