A 501c3, tax exempt, charitable organization, Great Lakes Mastiff Rescue, Inc exists solely to rescue, completely vet, spay/neuter and re-home Mastiffs that have been surrendered by their families who can no longer keep them or confiscated due to neglect or abuse. An all volunteer organization and foster home based, we cover five states surrounding the Great Lakes Region. Our program educates about the Mastiff breed, and responds to inquiries seeking assistance for behavior, training and health issues in an attempt to help families keep their Mastiffs.
