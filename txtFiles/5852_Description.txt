<p>We are a TNR (trap-neuter and release) group helping many cats in the NYC area. TNR is the only way to end the over popuation of feral cats. This prevents kittens from being born and starting the cycle all over again in 6-7 months. The trickle down effect of unaltered cats entering our shelters and being euthanized by NYS is not only inhumane but costing taxpayers countless monies spent unwisely. With no funding for TNR, many good citizens of our great state stand helpless with the ferals&nbsp;in need of help. Neighborhoods are flooding with unaltered cats in their communities with no where to turn. We at Friendly Ferals inc encourge TNR and reach out to TNR the colonies we are contacts to assist. We lack of money and trappers, we still reach about 1000 cats per year and adopt out&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;kittens we find in our endeavors. These are the kittens in dire need of a good home and a second chance. We adopt&nbsp;social and&nbsp;friendly kittens and cats that each have a story to touch your hearts! Please open your home for the holidays!</p>
<p>We are always in dire need of medications, towels, dishes, food, cleaning supplies (bleach), toys, traps and garbage bags. That is our wish to care for all we have. If you can help us we can help the cats! Without good people wiling to help, this could all not be possible!</p>
