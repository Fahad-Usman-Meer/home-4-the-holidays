<p>The Humane Society of Monroe County (HSMC) was founded in 1954 by Monroe County residents who were concerned for the welfare of the companion animals in our community. For approximately 50 years, the society has operated a shelter where stray, abandoned or surrendered animals receive care &ndash; food, shelter, medical attention and love &ndash; until they can be placed in a permanent home. The society also promotes the humane treatment of animals through education; attempts to re-unite lost animals with their owners and provides a subsidized low or no cost spay/neuter program for Monroe County residents on disability, Medicaid, social security or other income restrictions (contact the admin. office for more information or to see if you might qualify for this program.)</p>
<p>The HSMC is a non-profit, no-kill organization governed by a volunteer board of directors. We employ a small but dedicated staff to care for the animals, operate the shelter and conduct our outreach programs and events. Currently, the society does not receive government funding. Our budget is comprised of fundraising events, memberships, donations, cage sponsors and adoptions. A dedicated group of volunteers provides invaluable assistance in conducting our community outreach programs.</p>
