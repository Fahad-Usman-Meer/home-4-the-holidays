<p align="left">&nbsp;The <span class="style2">City of Buffalo Animal Shelter</span> provides our community with many services. It gives injured, abused, lost, and abandoned animals food, care, shelter, and comfort before finding loving and responsible homes for them. The shelter helps reunite families with lost pets. It also keeps potentially dangerous animals off the streets. </p>
<p>The animal control officers, the staff, and the volunteers at the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter work hard to serve and protect both animals and people, making our community a better place for everyone.</p>
