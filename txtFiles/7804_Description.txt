<p>Taysia Blue Siberian Husky Rescue is a 501(c) nonprofit organization.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We are committed to doing our part to create a world where there are no more homeless pets and reducing the number of Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes who are orphaned and killed in shelters</p>

<p>Our all volunteer mission provides a network to shelter, rehabilitate and re-home Siberian huskies and Alaskan Malamutes in The Midwest who are displaced, abused, neglected, abandoned or surrendered by their owners. Our goal is to place these dogs in loving, permanent and carefully screened homes.&nbsp;</p>
