Ditty Dats &amp; Dogs Rescue is a small rescue located in Martinsburg, WV.&nbsp; We average about 50 animals per year.&nbsp; Pets are kept in foster homes until permanent loving homes can be found for them.&nbsp; Most of the pets in the program come from high-kill shelters, and many of them were on the shelters euthanasia list before Ditty Dats &amp; Dogs agreed to rescue them.&nbsp; We strive to find excellent and permanent homes so none of our fury friends ever wind up back in a shelter on death row.&nbsp; Stop the over population of dogs and cats...
