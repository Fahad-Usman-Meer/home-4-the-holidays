PurrEver Ranch rescues Senior Kittizens from shelter euthanization.Â  Providing a safe hospice where the homeless, senior kittizens live the rest of their lives blanketed in love. We take in the "unadoptable", feed feral colonies, gentle spirits & soothe broken hearts & bones. Kittens that are trashed at the county dump are also rescued, as those that are dumped on the side of the road, our front porch step & from Animal Control that brings by babies they don't want to euth. If I see a homeless face, it will be rescued. My heart won't let my head turn away. PurrEver Ranch is a place of refuge for cats that would otherwise perish - the old, the abandoned, the abused, the sick & the suffering. We are the last hope, the last embrace, the last love, the last human. the last goodbye. Please help support our rescue efforts.
