Glynn County Animal Services is located in Brunswick, Ga. between Jacksonville, Fl and Savannah, Ga.&nbsp; We have many wonderful animals up for adoption every week. Our hours are 11 - 4 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. On Saturdays we take to the road and do a mobile adoption at various locations - usually in front of the Pet Supplies Plus store. Come help us save&nbsp;a life.&nbsp;You can also see our pets at <a href="http://www.glynncountyanimals.org">www.glynncountyanimals.org</a>. &nbsp;
