<p>Hickory Hill K9 Rescue was started in 1993 to help the overwhelming amount of animals that are abandoned, surrendered to county agencies and simply not wanted any more.&nbsp; These animals are facing death a lot of times due to no fault of their own other than not being convenient anymore.&nbsp; Our mission is to help stop the unnecessary killing of animals.&nbsp; Thousands of animals are put to sleep (some more humanely than others) every day.&nbsp; We strive to educate the public on the importance of spaying, neutering, heartworm preventive and general health care.&nbsp; We also strive to help owners who are experiencing difficulties with their pet find solutions to their problems.&nbsp; By helping them find solutions we keep the animals out of the county pounds and from just being abandoned.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is our policy to adopt out only healthy dogs and to do our best to know and understand what type of home the dog needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are always striving to find that &ldquo;forever home&rdquo; for the animals.</p>
