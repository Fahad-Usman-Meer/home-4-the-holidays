We are a state and federally licensed animal rescue and rehabilitation facility.&nbsp; We started out with wildlife, farm animals&nbsp;and exotics and branced out to domestics as well.&nbsp; We deal very frequantly with SPCAs, Police Departments and other legal agencices.&nbsp; We tend to take the unadoptables or difficult cases and dedicate ourselves to making them placable&nbsp;pets.&nbsp;
