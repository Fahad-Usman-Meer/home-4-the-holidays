Since their inception in 2004 they have saved the lives of nearly 400 dogs and puppies that would have faced an uncertain future on their own. The rescue is fully-funded through adoption fees and tax deductible donations.&nbsp; As stated by Lizanne, &quot;We believe that all animals are God's creatures and we are put on this earth to care for them as Christ cares for us. We also believe it is no accident that &quot;dog&quot; is God backwards.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
