<p><font face="Tahoma" size="3">1. to rescue abandoned rabbits whose time is up at animal shelters and to find permanent homes for them, and</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="3">2. to educate the public and assist humane societies, through publications on rabbit care, phone consultations and classes. Since 1988 more than 3,000 have been rescued through our foster homes across the country.<br />
Essential points of the House Rabbit Society philosophy are:</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="3">That all rabbits are valuable as individuals, regardless of breed, purity, temperament, state of health, or relationship to humans.</font></p>
<p><span class="maintext"><font face="Tahoma" size="3">&bull;That it is in the best interest of domestic rabbits to be neutered or spayed, to live in human housing, and to be treated for illnesses by veterinarians.</font></span></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size="3"><span class="maintext">&bull;That rabbits are intelligent, social animals that require mental stimulation, toys, exercise, environmental activity, and social interaction with, as appropriate, people, other rabbits and other household companion animals</span></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><span class="maintext"></span><font size="3"><font color="#000000">We rely entirely upon private donations or grants, and volunteer work to rescue, foster, and adopt out homeless rabbits while also educating the public about rabbit health and care.</font><br />
