WarmFuzzy&rsquo;s operates on a shoe string and we make many personal sacrifices in our efforts to save lives. We try to coordinate more direct adoptions but currently do very few as most of the animals we rescue are ferals, so adoption donations are few &amp; far between.&nbsp; Almost all of the animals that come through our doors stay here at WarmFuzzy&rsquo;s. We do receive donations &amp; are grateful for the generosity of our supporters &amp; the fact that these gifts often arrive at the times when we need help the most. Still it's not enough to cover the on-going costs of vetting, medications, food &amp; related necessities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need your donation to continue taking care of the kitties that have nowhere else to go.
