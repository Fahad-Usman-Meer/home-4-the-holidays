<strong><em>Mission Statement: Lucky Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving  unwanted dogs and finding them forever homes. Passionate about the  prevention of cruelty to animals, we want to be a leader within the  Colorado Springs community and educate the public on the importance of  spaying and neutering their pets, while advocating for animals that have  no voice, by offering training and other resources as alternatives to  re-homing.</em></strong>
