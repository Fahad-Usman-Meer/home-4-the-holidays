<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><font size="3" face="Verdana">Here Kitty Kitty, Inc. is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization, specializing in adoptions for homeless cats and kittens. Our priority is to find permanent, loving homes. We do not have a shelter. Instead, we rely on the goodness of foster parents who provide a loving transitional environment until a permanent home is found.<br />
</font></span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><font size="3" face="Verdana">The purpose of Here Kitty Kitty&nbsp;is to facilitate alternatives for finding loving homes for cats and kittens. We envision an educated future community where all cats and kittens are spayed or neutered, where there is no need for feral cat colonies and unnecessary euthanization of felines will not exist.</font></span></p>
