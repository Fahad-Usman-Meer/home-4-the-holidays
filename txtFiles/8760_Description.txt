<p>Canine Estates is a 501 (c) (3) rescue adoption sanctuary facility&nbsp;dedicated to saving the lifes of abused, abandoned and injured dogs primarily from high kill shelters.</p>

<p>The owners purchased a house and renovated it for the care of these precious dogs. These little ones have full run of the house and beautiful out doors to run and play.</p>

<p>At any given time we care for 35-40 dogs, therefore when you see our weekly adoptions of 2 or 3 although the numbers appear to be small, it is really huge to us.</p>

<p>We will always do a home visit before releasing a dog to a new owner. &nbsp;Until a wonderful home is found for our dogs; they remain at Canine Estates. &nbsp;I wanted to bring to your attention the size of our facility. &nbsp;We are on facebook and have a web site please follow us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for all you do for all precious animals.</p>
