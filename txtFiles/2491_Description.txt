<h1><u><font color="#ff0000">Who We Are</font></u></h1>
<font color="#9370d8">
<h2>Hello and Welcome to <font color="#ff00ff">Kelly's Kitten Rescue!<font color="#9370d8"> We are happy that you stopped by to check us out. We are a home based operation, non-profit,<font color="#dc143c"> no-kill<font color="#9370d8"> foster home, and all costs for the animals that we take care of come out of our pockets. We raise the kittens in a family/home environment; this means we do not use cages for any of the kittens. We have just started the rescue to help all the kittens that their mother has either ran away or has been killed and they don't have a clean warm forever home to call their own! We have taken in litters of kittens and mother cats in the past. We have worked with other rescue groups to find kittens homes. We have also done volunteer work with area animal shelters. We take abandoned mother cats that are expecting and find forever homes for them and their babies when they are ready at about 8 week of age and the mother gets a home as soon as she is healed up from being spayed after the kittens are weaned from her. We also take in bottle babies (under 3 weeks of age). We have only had a few of the bottle babies to take care of and have had a 100% success rate with them. We teach the babies good socialization skills and house manners along with the mother cat if she is not used to being a house cat. The kittens are raised with other cat friends and a standard daschound who weighs 32 lbs that thinks he is a cat so they will be well socialized with different animals. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU ADOPT ONE YOU ARE ACTUALLY SAVING THE LIVES OF TWO ANIMALS. THE ONE YOU ARE ADOPTING AND THE ONE THAT WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO THE RESCUE WHEN THAT SPACE IS OPENED UP FROM BEING ADOPTED!!! <br />
PLACING UNWANTED, ABANDONED KITTENS IN LOVING HOMES WITH RESPOSIBLE, LOVING, &amp; CARING PEOPLE IS OUR MAIN GOAL!</font></font></font></font></h2>

<h2><font color="#20b2aa">If you are interested in adopting one of our kittens you will have to fill out an adoption agreement, application, and a questionire for us to get to know you. We can send you an agreement and application if you e-mail us at<font color="#0000cd"> chloiebear21@yahoo.com<font color="#20b2aa"> and <font color="#0000cd">please put in the TITLE you are inquiring about the kittens please no phone calls. We do not like to open E-mails that don't have a Title. Also it helps from being sent directly to the SPAM folder to never be seen again. <font color="#20b2aa">The<font color="#dc143c"> adoption fee<font color="#20b2aa"> for one of the kittens <font color="#dc143c">8 weeks - 5 months<font color="#20b2aa"> is<font color="#dc143c"> $100<font color="#20b2aa"> and if you are interested in adopting<font color="#20b2aa"> a <font color="#dc143c">6 month old kitten or older or a mother cat<font color="#20b2aa"> the fee is<font color="#dc143c"> $90.<font color="#20b2aa"> The mother &amp; 6 month old or older kittens will be fixed before they leave the rescue. We think these prices are reasonable when you consider the actual cost of a free to good home kitten or cat. <br />
<br />
<font color="#9370d8">To insure that our kittens are healthy some of the health issues we test for are Felv/FIV a kitten with either of these deadly diseases will not be adopted out by us. They are also checked for and if needed treated for all types of worms &amp; other parasite. They receive their kitten vaccinations, flea preventive, and regular vet checks while they are in our care. All these services are done and paid for by<font color="#ff00ff"> Kelly&rsquo;s Kitten Rescue. <br />
<br />
<font color="#ff4500">Studies have shown that most kittens want a member of their own species for companionship...it&lsquo;s great to have a friend! So why not adopt two kittens so when you or your family are not at home they will not be as upset that you are not there. It also makes a well-adjusted and less destructive pet. <br />
<br />
<font color="#bc8f8f">All kittens will be adopted out with a signed spay/neuter agreement stating that when they come of age they will be taken to the vet, to be spay/neutered, usually at 6 months of age. If a kitten has not been spay/neutered when they are of age the kitten will be turned back over to<font color="#ff00ff"> Kelly&rsquo;s Kitten Rescue<font color="#bc8f8f"> to find an owner that is a responsible pet owner. None of the kittens will be adopted out until they are 8 weeks of age and 2 lbs in weight. Adopting a kitten too young can lead to socialization and behavioral problems. This is also to help protect the kitten's health and well being, Any mother cats or 6 month and older kitten that we adopt out will be spayed before they leave our home. We do require that all kittens/cats be <font color="#dc143c">INDOORS ONLY!<font color="#bc8f8f"> Cats &amp; kittens can get into too much trouble being outside (hit by car, diseases, animal attack, etc). If needed we will take back any animal adopted from us no matter how long it has been and we will find it another suitable home. <br />
<br />
<font color="#ff00ff">Please feel free to look and see the kittens that we have available for adoption. If you have any questions please e-mail us and we will respond to your e-mails. We do not allow any pet that is adopted from us to be transported through the airlines. If you are interested enough in one of the kittens you will be willing to make the drive to pick up your new kitty. We do not fly kittens or cats because it is just too stressful on the cat/kitten!!!<font color="#dc143c"> ONLY people willing to drive and pick up. NO KITTEN will fly or be shipped to a new home, NO EXCEPTIONS!<font color="#ff00ff"> Thank you for wanting to give a home to a rescue kitten. We would also like to advise that we do not allow any of the kittens (8 weeks - 5 months) to be adopted to people that have children 8yrs and younger. People that have a children 8 yrs and younger are allowed to adopt a kitten/cat that is 6 months or older. <font color="#dc143c">PLEASE INDOOR HOMES ONLY. <br />
<br />

<font color="#000000"><font color="#ff00ff">
<h1><font color="#ff0000">Before beginning the adoption process please, ask yourself these two (2) important questions:</font></h1>
<font color="#0000ff">Will my cat be left alone at home for 8 to 10 hours per day? <font color="#20b2aa">Cats enjoy the company of others and often form intense pair bonds either with their human companions or other animals. Leaving a cat or kitten alone for long periods of time, without human or feline/canine companionship, can lead to problems such as scratching, aggressive play, dietary and/or litter box issues. <font color="#dc143c"><br />
<br />
If you work long hours (don&rsquo;t forget to count commute time, children&rsquo;s after school activities, etc.) and don&rsquo;t have someone else to provide care and companionship for your cat while you are away, consider adopting two cats. Two cats adopted together are easier and happier and have fewer problems than one lonely bored animal. This is especially true for kittens who require a great deal of socialization in order to develop appropriate and acceptable household behavior. <br />
<br />
<font color="#0000ff">Am I willing and able to pay an adoption fee of $90 or $100?<font color="#ff00ff">Kelly&rsquo;s Kitten Rescue<font color="#b8860b"> is looking for a responsable partner who understand that in order for <font color="#ff00ff">Kelly&rsquo;s Kitten Rescue<font color="#b8860b"> to continue saving cats, we must find adopters who are prepared and able to make a life-long commitment to a cat. <font color="#228b22"><br />
<br />
Although the ability to pay a $90 or $100 adoption fee is not the primary consideration when<font color="#ff00ff"> Kelly&rsquo;s Kitten Rescue<font color="#228b22"> evaluates an adoption application, it is certainly part of our decision. The inability to pay an adoption fee raises a warning flag: can the new adopter truly afford to care for a pet? <font color="#808080"><br />
<br />
If you can&rsquo;t afford a $90, or $100 adoption fee, perhaps you should re-examine your decision to adopt. Vet bills can be expensive and unforeseen. Even routine veterinary care, food bills and dental care is expensive, as are grooming, pet sitting, etc.<font color="#ff00ff"> Kelly&rsquo;s Kitten Rescue<font color="#808080"> needs to feel certain that the cats we place will not be affected by an adopters financial instability.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></h2>
