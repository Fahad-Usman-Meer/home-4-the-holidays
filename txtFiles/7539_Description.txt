<p>DAWG provides a safe and loving environment for dogs awaiting permanent <br />
adoption, and promotes their adoption through outreach programs in the Santa <br />
Barbara community.</p>
<p>Most of the dogs in our care come from Santa Barbara county shelters. Our <br />
primary goal is to reduce the rate of euthanasia in the county shelters by <br />
providing the medical care and training many dogs need for a second chance at <br />
life.</p>
<p>Since DAWG&rsquo;s inception in 1991, we have worked hard to bring out the best in <br />
our dogs, improving their quality of life during their stay at the shelter, and <br />
placing healthy, well-behaved dogs back into the community</p>
