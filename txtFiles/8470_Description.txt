<p>Our organization focuses on trap, neuter, and return efforts. We socialize feral kittens for placement into homes when ready. We occasionally find a few friendly cats that are removed from colonies and if not claimed are placed through adoption. We spay approximately 40 to 80 cats monthly. We utilize foster homes throughout our county and typically have between 30 and 50 cats/ kittens at any given time waiting for forever homes. We focus on quality adoptions with every adoption and have many pleased adopters. Our vet even offers free exams for our adopters, all cats/ kittens at least three months of age are spayed/ neutered prior to placement. Our organization goes into the community and traps areas where people can not or do not know how to trap. We show others how to trap and provide information on the importance of spay/ neuter.&nbsp;</p>
