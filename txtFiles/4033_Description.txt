<p>Pitter Patter Paws and L.I.F.A.C. work together to give homeless cats and kittens a 2nd chance. Finding not only permanent homes for domestic homeless cats we also have feral cats that need a suitable barn to reside in. All cats and kittens are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, tested for Fiv and Felv. All of our animals reside in foster homes to get them adjusted to a home environement with people&nbsp;and to learn their true personalities. Please contact us by email <a href="mailto:lifacsq@yahoo.com">lifacsq@yahoo.com</a> or call us to inquire about giving a homeless cat a home or if you have a barn that is suitable for feral cats.&nbsp;</p>
