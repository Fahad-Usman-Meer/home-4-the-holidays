<strong>Kansas City Siamese Rescue</strong> is a no-kill, non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing homeless and abandoned Siamese Cats and other select breeds. Our ultimate goal is to find permanent, forever homes for these wonderful animals where they will be cherished and loved for the rest of their lives. We spend our time caring for their physical, as well as emotional, needs during the process of screening prospective &quot;parents.&quot;
