Adoptions are processed at the shelter after an approved adoption application and interview during regular business hours.<br />
<br />
Adoption fees are only $99.00 for dogs or cats through 2011! That includes the spay or neuter sugery which is performed by a local contracted veterinarian after the adoption is completed. This shelter has a mandatory spay/neuter policy. *For animals not yet old enough for surgery (determined by shelter staff) there is an additional Alteration deposit of $50 is required which is fully refundable when the surgery is completed and paperwork recieved by the shelter/city within the allowed time.<br />
<br />
Along with the basic spay/neuter surgery, the adoption fee also includes a microchip to help reunite you with your pet should they ever become lost or stolen, their first distemper combo vaccination (FVRCP for cats / DHLLPP-CVK for dogs), a one-year license (for adopters living within our service area), as well as a blood test for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus(cats only). This test is performed at a local participating veterinarian and must be completed within 10 days of adoption.<br />
<br />
<br />
We house stray animals also. If you have lost an animal from one of our service areas, please contact shelter personel as soon as possible to see if your pet has been impounded. We highly recommend that you come into the shelter personally to check for your pet! Descriptions vary from one person to another and you will know your pet first!<br />
<br />
Volunteer opportunities! We DO have opportunites for volunteering at the shelter. Applications are always accepted for volunteer positions and are filled as openings become available. Please call for further info. You must be at least 16 years of age to volunteer. </a></p>
