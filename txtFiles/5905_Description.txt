<p><span id="preview-local-desc">&nbsp; Greyhound Rescue Sydney is committed to rescuing, saving and rehoming Greyhounds.&nbsp; We are reliant on the kindess of volunteers to help with fostering.&nbsp; We are in urgent need of foster carers in Sydney, unfortunately we dont have enough carers at the moment and many Greyhounds that would make great pets are being euthanasied.</span></p>
<div>Despite the public's perceptions Retired Greyhounds make excellent low maintenance pets.&nbsp; They only require walking for 20-30 mins, 3 times a week, but will take more if you offer it! They sleep for about 20 hours a day.&nbsp; They have short coats that rarely shed and no doggy smell. They are very easily house trained (in fact almost all of our Greyhounds will come to you toilet trained).&nbsp; They are a very &quot;sooky&quot; animal just looking for a bit of company and soft place to sleep.&nbsp; Retired racers are generally aged between 2 &amp; 5 years old they are out of the &quot;puppy&quot; stage and are suitable for families, couples, singles and can easily live in&nbsp;places with little or no backyards.&nbsp; They come in a range of colours such as Blue (rare), brindle, red, white and black, but its what inside that really counts.&nbsp; Owners of greyhounds are rewarded with such love and affection that they generally end up with more than one!&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Currently we have a number of males and females in foster care, that have passed their fostering period and are ready to go to their forever homes.&nbsp; If you think a greyhound might be for you or you are not sure, you can always foster with&nbsp;a view to adopt.&nbsp; All greyhounds come vet checked, desexed, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested &amp; treated. Our adoption fee is $250, a low fee for a purebred animal.&nbsp;</div>
