<p>The Arizona Humane Society was built on a foundation of compassion and kindness toward animals. As AHS evolves, it is focused on inspiring compassion in others through its appreciation of humanity and its reflection in animals. Animals provide unconditional love regardless of the hardships they&rsquo;ve faced.&nbsp; AHS makes every effort to model its own behavior on the accepting, gentle spirit of animals with the hope of compelling the community to act on their behalf.</p>
