<p>We are a group of volunteers dedicated to helping unwanted and abandoned animals find new loving homes. We are also committed to educating the public on the benefits of spaying and neutering their pets. Also we try to assist as many people and animals as we can by helping them place kittens and puppies through a kitten and puppy placement program.We do this by placing the kittens/puppies in new homes and get the mom animal spayed to eliminate any further litters. We are always looking for volunteers and fosters. Donations are greatly appreciated. We are a 501 (c)3 non profit group.&nbsp; &nbsp;We do adoptions at the PETCO location in Conroe, Tx. We also work with our local animal control to help the animals at the pound so they are not put down. We are their only hope. Any adoptions help make more room for these guys to get out. Thank you so much for any help you may give even if it is just prayers</p>
