<p><strong>Cyan&#39;s Private Garden Rescue</strong>; is located in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cyan is the founders personal dog who gives the rescue it&#39;s<br />
inspiration.Through her loyal divineness she has inspired me to do<br />
greater good in the animal community. Because of her, I work to make the<br />
community she lives in, a safer place to live for her and the other<br />
animals. Cyan has opened her home to share with other dogs, until a safe<br />
and secure home can be found for them through adoptions.</p>
