Welcome to Wish Bone Rescue, Rehabilitation and Rehoming. We are a not-for-profit, all volunteer, no-kill organization located in Central Illinois, whose primary focus is to find responsible, loving and permanent homes for the surrendered, abandoned, neglected or abused dogs from within our community. We do not discriminate based on a dog&rsquo;s breed, age or health ... this is done exclusively through our FOSTER HOME PROGRAM as we believe in the importance of placing our dogs in a loving and caring home environment as soon as possible.
