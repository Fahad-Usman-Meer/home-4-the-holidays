<font face="Arial">We are the Vet Clinic on Fort Drum, near Watertown, NY.&nbsp; We operate a small co-located shelter.&nbsp; Because we are on a military installation with a high deployment rate, we receive a huge variety of animals.&nbsp; The shelter is mainly run by a few dedicated volunteers with the wonderful support of the Vet Clinic staff.&nbsp; We are always in need of donations, mainly dog and cat food and kitty litter (and of course, monitary), but we accept anything in that is in good condition (leashes, bowls, collars, gentle leaders, ect).&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need volunteers and foster homes.</font>
