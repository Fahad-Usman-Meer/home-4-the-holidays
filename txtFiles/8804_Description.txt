<p>SOS (Save Our Snoopies) Beagle Rescue, Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to the placement of abandoned and neglected beagles. SOS Beagle Rescue, Inc. was founded in New Jersey in 1991. It is a non-profit, tax-exempt, ALL VOLUNTEER organization, and was one of the first beagle rescues of its kind in the country. We now have three chapters, in New Jersey, Tennessee and Alabama. SOS Beagle Rescue has assisted in finding loving homes for thousands of beagles, with over 1000 successful adoptions. We are not concerned with the NUMBER of beagles we adopt out every year, but the quality of the adoptions. We do our best to direct our limited resources to those areas of greatest need.</p>
