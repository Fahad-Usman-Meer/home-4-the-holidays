<font size="4" face="georgia, 'times new roman', serif" editor_id="mce_editor_0">First and foremost, our organization is a network of non-paid volunteers. Volunteers who have jobs, families, interests, and our own pets. We give selflessly because it is in our very core. Trust me when I say that we wish our second &quot;jobs&quot; as rescuers were not necessary. <br />
<br />
We would like to reiterate a very important part of our name...we are a rescue aimed at helping the STRAY population. <br />
<br />
We promote responsible pet ownership and will certainly offer suggestions on how you may successfully keep your pet in your home. We accept owner surrendered companion pets on a <em>case by case basis</em>. We do request you submit your information on our <a mce_real_href="page3.html" target="_self" href="http://www.straysave.com/straysandsurrenders.html">Strays and Surrenders Page</a>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Sadly, we don't have unlimited&nbsp;time, space, and funds to be able to help each homeless pet.&nbsp;Each animal that comes into our program must be spayed or neutered, have a physical exam, be vaccinated for distemper, bordatella, and rabies, have a heartworm test and microchip if a dog and a feline leukemia test for a cat, and of course they need to eat, have things to play with, beds to sleep on, treatment for parasites, and of course LOVE. <br />
<br />
The average cost for a healthy dog not needing any additional medical treatment, but the above is $135, and for a cat is about $80. Monthly heartworm and flea treatment per animal runs $5-$15. Food cost varies on the size of the animal, and cat litter is a constant need. If the animal has any additional medical ailments or injuries as many strays do, the bill can be hundreds or even thousands of dollars.<br />
<br />
Some of our long term goals include:&nbsp; implementing a low-cost spay/neuter program, and coordinating a Trap and Release (TnR) stray cat program aimed at providing homeless and feral cats with vaccines, and to control the population by having them altered.<br />
<br />
These are BIG goals and YOU CAN HELP! Please contact us to <a mce_real_href="page2.html" target="_self" href="http://www.straysave.com/volunteering.html">volunteer</a> or donate. Your time and effort is appreciated not only by us, but by the many animals that are cold and hungry, waiting to be found...</font><font face="georgia, 'times new roman', serif"><br />
