The Washington Ferret Rescue and Shelter averages approximately 70-80 ferrets available for adoption and another 70 in foster care. We rely on donations and adoptions to suitable home environments to keep our doors open. Please visit our website or come see us in person on Saturdays from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm.
