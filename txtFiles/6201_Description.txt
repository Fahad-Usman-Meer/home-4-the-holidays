Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF) is a non-profit, no-kill rescue organization located in Mobile, Alabama.
Animal Rescue Foundation was founded in December, 1995 and is run by all-volunteers.  ARF does not receive any government funding or subsidies.
ARF cares for all animals, regardless of age, breed, illness or disability and believe that these precious souls are to be given the respect of any other God-created life.  Please join us in our mission to provide an animal-loving community where pets are at home, not home-less.
