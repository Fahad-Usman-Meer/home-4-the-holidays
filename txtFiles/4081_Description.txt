We are aimal control for o'fallon missouri. We are in desperate need of volunteers, donations and adoptions. My goal is to get these woderful pets out of here and I am proud to say we have not had to euthanize 1 adoptable pet since we have been open.Please go to petfinder.com and look for tender care adoption center and thats where all of our pets are at.
