 All of our animals can be viewed anytime on our website. We are currently beyond capacity and are looking for some wonder fur-ever homes for our wonderful cats and dogs. 

How to Adopt
The adoption process begins by coming in to view our many wonderful animals. The applicant will then fill out an application and be interviewed and observed interacting with the pet of their choice. If the adoption is approved by a shelter attendant, the adoption is completed when fees are paid and appropriate paperwork signed and processed. The Royal Oak Animal Shelter reserves the right to deny an adoption if the applicant is deemed not to be able to provide an appropriate home for the animal under consideration. If you are 55 yrs or older, we have a new Senior Adoption Program with low-cost cat adoptions. 

Adoption Fees
Cats & Kittens $85
Dogs & Puppies $180
Sterilization deposit	$50
