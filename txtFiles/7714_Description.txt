Whisker Connection  is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization founded in 2010  to reduce the number of cats killed in area shelters. Whisker  Connection believes that all cats deserve a chance at life, whether old,  injured, unkempt, or otherwise deemed &quot;unadoptable&quot; by other shelters.&nbsp;
<p>We  hope for a no-kill community in which the lives of cats are valued and  respected and where abandoned, lost, or feral cats are not viewed as a  nuisance but as beings that may need our assistance and care.    </p>
<p>  </p>
<h2><font color="#Fe9829">What We Do</font></h2>
We have a three-prong approach to reduce the area cat population.
<ol>
    <li><strong>Trap-Neuter-Return.</strong> We have created a <a href="http://www.whiskerconnection.org/tnr.php">TNR program</a> in which we trap feral cats, alter them, and then return them to their outside home. </li>
    <li><strong>Education.</strong> Reaching out to the public about the importance of neutering  pets.  </li>
    <li><strong>Adoption.</strong> Finding cats responsible, loving homes either through <a href="http://www.whiskerconnection.org/available.php">adoption</a> or transferring to other no-kill shelters.  </li>
</ol>

<h2><font color="#a4e048">The Future</font></h2>
<p>  </p>
<p> We are working to create a low-cost spay/neuter and vaccination clinic for Knox County and surrounding communities. </p>
Our primary goal is to one day have a compassionate, no-kill cat shelter in Knox County.&nbsp;
