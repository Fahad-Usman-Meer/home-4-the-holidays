Famous Fido works with overcrowded Chicago-area shelters to rescue adoptable dogs that are at high risk of euthanasia, and to find them loving homes. We have a small boarding facility and a growing foster network. Our animals are vet checked, spay/neutered, vaccinated, and micro chipped. We encourage all potential guardians to commit to training and working with our animals to make them the best companion they can be. The $175.00 adoption fee helps offset cost of caring for our animals. To schedule an appointment to meet and greet any of the dogs shown above give us a call at 773-907-0305.
