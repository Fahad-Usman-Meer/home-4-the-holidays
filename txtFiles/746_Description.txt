We are an organization of volunteers who love animals and wish to help them.  We strive to educate the public about proper pet care, offer an indigent care program for spay/neuter and health care, distribute educational materials to area elementary schools, offer a foster care program to adopt animals and work in conjunction with area animal control to help find homes for the numerous strays and homeless in our area. We try to be strong advocates for the animals in our community.
