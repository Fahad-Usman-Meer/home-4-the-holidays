<p>The Randolph Regional Animal Shelter is operated by township staff and a core group of dedicated volunteers who have made it their mission to provide humane care for stray, abandoned and injured animals. To that end, although every animal taken in receives the best care possible, the ultimate goal of shelter personnel is to find a loving, stable home for each animal in its care.&nbsp;<br />
