Bandit's Adoption &amp; Rescue of K-9s was formed for the express purpose of rescuing orphaned or abandoned pets and other adoptable dogs from local shelters and finding loving, forever homes for them. All B.A.R.K. dogs are taken to local participating veterinarians and tested for disease, neutered or spayed, and given all age-appropriate inoculations. B.A.R.K. volunteer foster-parents provide safe environments for rescued animals until they are adopted by loving individuals and families. Our first priority is the health, care and safety of our animals. B.A.R.K. operates soley by volunteers who donate their time, talent and compassion. Please be patient with us. We promise to do our very best to review and respond promptly to all your inquiries on all our furry friends.
<p>B.A.R.K. is a nonprofit, tax exempt 501 (c)(3) organization run strictly by donations. </p>
