<p>Puggles &amp; Pitties is a very small rescue based in San Diego, CA. I rescue just a handful of dogs at a time, rehabilitate them&nbsp;as necessary, and find&nbsp;their new forever homes. I focus on puggles (pug/beagle mixes), pit bull-type dogs, and boxers.<br />
<br />
The puggles &amp; boxers I rescue come from rural shelters in states like MO, IL, IA, OK, OH, KY, and GA. I'm frequently asked why I rescue those dogs and not local dogs. The fact of the matter is that very few puggles are dying in the shelters in Southern California (and if you know of one at risk, let me know)! The rural shelters I work with have 90% euthanasia rates (meaning that's how many of their dogs are killed) and they are horrible places. The facilities usually have&nbsp;3 - 5 runs each; the kennels are generally outdoors regardless of the climate, and there are too many dogs crammed together into each kennel. Some of the shelters are still using gas chambers to put the dogs down. So yes, I rescue from out of this area. In many cases I'm the only chance those dogs have of getting out alive.</p>

<p>If you're considering a dog as a holiday present, please think carefully before commiting to one. Dogs are a lot of time, energy, and money over the course of their lives, so this is not a decision to make lightly. If you have already decided on getting a pet for the holidays, PLEASE adopt one from your local shelter or rescue. Too many animals are dying every day to justify buying one from a pet store or breeder.</p>
