<p>Coos County Animal Shelter is located on the beautiful Southern&nbsp;Oregon Coast in Coos Bay. It is the only shelter in the county with a population of 60,000 people. We&nbsp;have 28&nbsp;dog kennels&nbsp;and&nbsp;12 cat&nbsp;cages. We are a very small shelter with only two&nbsp;staff employees.&nbsp;They are both Animal Control Officers covering the County for the State&nbsp;Animal Humane&nbsp;Laws&nbsp;and managing the shelter. We depend on volunteers to help&nbsp;us with the every day shelter duties. The hours of the shelter are also limited, 12-4 Tuesday through Saturday.</p>
<p>The limited funding for the shelter animals has us depend on other sources for vaccines, worming, flea control, or anything else that is not in the shelter budget.&nbsp; Two organizations Friends of Coos County Animals (FOCCAS) and Friends of Animals With Needs (FAWN) help provide needed items.</p>
