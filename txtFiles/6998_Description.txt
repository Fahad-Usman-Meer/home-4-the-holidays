<p>Ark of Hope Animal Rescue has been rescuing animals for 21+ years now! We take in abused, abandoned and neglected animals. Once at The Ark they are taken to our Vet for a complete check up and most often discuss a plan for their medical, rehab and recovery process. Each animal is spayed or neutered, cats are tested of Feline FIV &amp; Leukemia,&nbsp;vaccinated, wormed, tested for heartworms, they will receive surgery if needed, treated for&nbsp;fleas and then flea and tick preventative applied. Once the animal is healthy medically and socially, they are ready to be adopted. Then the&nbsp;adoption process starts. An adoption application must be filled out, references called, including their vet hospital, a home visit is scheduled and once everything is completed the adoption contract is signed.&nbsp;Ark of Hope Animal Rescue works completely by volunteers and public donations. We are a 501(c)3 organization, where every penny that comes into The Ark, goes completely for the animals needs.</p>
