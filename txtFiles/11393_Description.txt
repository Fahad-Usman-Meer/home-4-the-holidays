<p>DC Shiba Inu Rescue (DCSIR) is a group of dedicated volunteers whose mission is to rescue, foster, vet and train neglected, homeless, abandoned and stray Shiba Inus. It also works with owner surrenders to help keep Shibas in their current home or to foster and rehome via its extensive adoption process. DCSIR is committed to prioritizing the intake and placement of Shiba Inus in the immediate DC metropolitan area and may assist in the rescue effort for Shiba Inus and mixed breeds across the east coast as circumstances allow.</p>

<p>DCSIR is a community-oriented rescue which strives to educate pet owners about positive behavior training, healthy nutrition and alternative health care, primitive breed temperament and the importance of spaying/neutering.</p>
