<p>Shelter2Rescue Coaltion is a mixed breed cat and dog rescue. We work as a liason to a few rural shelters to keep the euthanasia rate low. We are found on FaceBook and Petfinder, Adoptapet and a few other pages out there. <br />
We fully vet our cats and dogs before or sometimes after adoptions due to being to young for spay or neuter at the time. <br />
All these animals are in need of a good home. All shapes and sizes and different temperments. We usually have a dog or cat that will fit to you household needs. <br />
<br />
To continue to be successful, we need adopters and foster support. </p>
