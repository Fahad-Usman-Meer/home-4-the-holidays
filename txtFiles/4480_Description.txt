<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: " face="'Palatino Linotype','serif'" color="#805959">Most people are unaware of what really goes on in shelters across the United States.&nbsp; Our goal is to raise this awareness.&nbsp; Many shelters are high kill&nbsp;shelters.&nbsp; Mostly due to lack of financing, lack of volunteer, and lack of space.&nbsp; A large percentage of these shelters are gassing shelters.&nbsp; This means that they are placed in a gas chamber to be euthanized.&nbsp; This caused these dogs extreme pain.&nbsp; Remember, we cannot save them all, but we're saving one life at a time.&nbsp; This information can be very heart wrenching and hard to deal with.&nbsp; Anything you do to help whether it be spread the word, donate, foster, or adopt; is&nbsp;helping save one life at a time.&nbsp; Everything you do matters much more than you see.&nbsp; We are able to help because of people like you.</span></p>
