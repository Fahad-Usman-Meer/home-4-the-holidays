Angel Wings is a home based cat rescue based in San Marcos, CA. All our cats are fostered in private homes, and are safe and cared for until a forever home is found. There are currently 3 different homes that foster our cats.&nbsp; We have the opportunity to tell prospective adopters about specific personality traits, dietary issues, and any unique aspects of a cat or kitten in our program.
