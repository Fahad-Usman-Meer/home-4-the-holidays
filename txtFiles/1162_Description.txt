<p>~~The Humane Society of Kandiyohi/Meeker Counties believes that there is a unique and reciprocal bond between humans and animals that can be a vital and positive influence in society. Because of this belief, we provide a safe and sheltering haven for lost and abandoned animals pending placement in a suitable, permanent home. We also promote responsible care and training for household pets through education and public awareness.</p>
