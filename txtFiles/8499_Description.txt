Lone Woof Rescue is a non-profit no kill dog rescue, rehabilitation and adoption center serving southern Nevada and surrounding areas. Our belief is that every dog has a place it belongs and our goal is to help him or her get there. To meet the needs of our dogs we have recently moved to Sandy Valley, Nevada and are expanding our facilities. 

Your contributions will go directly to improving the quality of life for all Lone Woof Rescue dogs. For example, vet care, dog food and treats, bedding, flea & tick medicine, grooming and general rescue upkeep costs. 

On behalf of JD & all the dogs at Lone Woof Rescue, we welcome you to our wolf pack! 

Paws up!
