<p>We are no longer participating in the Home for the Holidays Campagn as long as Blue Buffalo is running it. They refused to take a stand against BSL and only removed offending material once social media applied pressure AND STILL refused to take a stand either way. OUR SHELTER IS AGAINST BSL, so morally and ethically we can not accept any benefits or participate in the program any longer.</p>
