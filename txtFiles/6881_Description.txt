<p><strong><font size="4">Halteman's Haven is a unique 501C3 rescue group that primarily deals in cat rescue. The majority of our animals are special needs, the ones no one else will take the time and expense to heal. We believe all animals should be given a chance to live. We have found that even if an animal was abused by human hands, they still turn to human hands for love once they are healed.</font></strong> </p>
