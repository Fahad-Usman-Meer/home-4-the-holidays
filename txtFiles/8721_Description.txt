<p>Our mission is to help keep as many cats as possible from being  brought into animal control &ndash; be they feral, stray, or owner turn in;  rescue as many cats as possible from out of the shelter with the  resources we have available; and focus locally so that the metro area  cats don&rsquo;t fall through the cracks simply because they have standard  suburban stories.</p>

<h2>How will we do this?</h2>
<p>At this time, there are no low-cost spay/neuter stand-alone clinics  or mobile units serving the citizens of Cobb County GA. We are working  to establish a low-cost spay/neuter stand-alone clinic to keep cats (and  dogs) from entering animal control because of high birth rates or  because people are struggling financially and can no longer afford to  care for their pets. The clinic services would be available for the  general public, rescues that take animals into their program from local  county animal control shelters and rescues/individuals that trap,  neuter, and return (TNR) feral cats.</p>
<p>Other ways we are working to keep the shelter intake numbers down  include: educating the public on responsible pet ownership; referring  those in need to community resources; and training the community on TNR.   We also advocate for and educate about the need for pet licensing,  yearly registration, and micro-chipping  cats and dogs so they can more  easily find their way home again.</p>
<p>All half the way home cats live in foster homes and are adopted out  via online pet finding services, our half the way home website, social  media exposure, adoption events, and by word of mouth.</p>
