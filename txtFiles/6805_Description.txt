Mingus Manor is a 501 (c) 3 non profit organization that has been organized to provide lifetime care to senior and special needs animals.&nbsp; These animals have been deemed unadoptable due to their age, illness or handicap.&nbsp; We provide all the love, food and medical care they need for rest of their lives on a safe and warm 5 acre facility.&nbsp; They are free to roam the property, lay in the grass under big trees&nbsp;or sleep on the couch.
