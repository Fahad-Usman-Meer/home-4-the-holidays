One Paw at a Time is a not-for-profit all breed rescue that is compromised of dedicated volunteers that are committed to rehabilitating and rehoming animals that were found as strays, pulled from local kill shelters, or owner surrender.&nbsp; All dogs available for adoption are up to date on vaccinations, tested for heartworm, on heartworm preventative, wormed, microchipped, and spay/neutered.&nbsp; We require that all applicants have a fenced in yard to keep their new family member safe and provide an area for exercise.&nbsp; All applicants must complete an adoption application and have a home visit completed to insure a right match for both our furry friend and the adopter.&nbsp; We reserve the right to refuse adoption of any animal for any reason.&nbsp;
