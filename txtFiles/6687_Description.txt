Founded in 1983, we are a network of volunteers who rescue homeless cats and kittens. Each animal is neutered or spayed, vaccinated, tested for FeLV / FIV, and given any medical attention they require . They are then put up for adoption. We rely entirely on donations to perform this work. We do not have a shelter building but care for the animals in our homes so we are only able to care for a few animals at a time. We are a registered non-profit organization. Any donations are greatly appreciated and can be sent to Abandoned Animals Inc. 82 Woods Rd. Bethany, CT 06524. Checks payable to Abandoned Animals Inc. Thank you
If You Are Feeding A Stray Cat

It 's important to get the stray neutered or spayed, otherwise, more homeless kittens will be born and soon the situation will be out of control. A stray cat can be neutered/spayed and then, after a short recovery period of a day or two, be released back to where she/he was found. This is humane and responsible.

If you need to trap a stray cat, please contact your local animal control officer, or TEAM Mobile Vet clinic at 1-888-367-8326. Abandoned Animals no longer loans out traps. 


If you are interested in adopting one of our cats or kittens, please email Laurieo30@aol.com for more information. Thank you!!
