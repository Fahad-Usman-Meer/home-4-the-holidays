 ..is a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania. We work to protect animals from cruelty and abuse. We believe that through animal awareness and education we have the key to opening the door to solving pet overpopulation. Our goal is to achieve compassionate ethics in people's relationships with animals. Our policy is to rescue and return lost animals to their owners and seek suitable homes for animals without owners. We will shelter the homeless and continue to enforce the animal protection laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
