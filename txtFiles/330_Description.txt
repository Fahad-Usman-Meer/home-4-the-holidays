CatNap from the Heart is a nonprofit facility located in LaGrange Park IL, a western suburb of Chicago.&nbsp; We are a no-kill shelter and have been nonprofit since 2003.&nbsp; We adopt out cats, small mammals and birds, with cats being our main focus.&nbsp; All of our cats are spayed or neutered prior to adoption, even at 12 weeks of age.&nbsp; We receive no Federal, county or village funding and depend solely on adoptions, donations, and fundraisers.
