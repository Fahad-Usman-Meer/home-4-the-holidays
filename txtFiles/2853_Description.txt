<p>In 2006, OHS found new adopted homes for 8,671 pets. Our &quot;save rate&quot; (adoptions, plus transfers to other humane groups and reunions with owners) for dogs was 99 percent; for cats it was 86 percent. Our adoption rates are quite impressive when compared to the national average (25 percent for dogs and 20 percent for cats). We are proud of our efforts and the Board, staff, and volunteers of OHS are committed to placing 100 percent of the animals brought to OHS for adoption into new, loving homes.</p>
