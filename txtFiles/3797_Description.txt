<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Last Chance Rescue is an all volunteer group of individuals who are dedicated to making a difference in the lives of the animals in San Patricio County.&nbsp;We are not a shelter or a rescue with a building, rather we are an INTERVENTION group who works with the animals in the Ingleside Animal Control Facility to find them homes before they are destroyed. With the support of the City of Ingleside animals are offered a &quot;Second Chance at Life&quot;&nbsp; The City has partnered up with local veterinarians to provide a low-cost spay/neuter option to any individual who chooses to adopt from Ingleside Animal Facility.&nbsp; The only way to stem the tide of animals being euthanized is to spay and neuter.</font></p>
