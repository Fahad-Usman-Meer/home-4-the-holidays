<p>Southern Skies Labrador Rescue &amp; Adoption, Inc. (SSLR) is a non-profit dedicated to the rescue and adoption of Labradors and other working dog breeds that have been abandoned at Alabama kill shelters, owner surrenders and strays. We strive to communicate for the voiceless by working closely with local and national animal rescues and other groups for the benefit of animal welfare and to promote changes in our local Alabama laws.
