Bright Futures Farm is a 501c3 equine charity.&nbsp; We find homes for horses in need, and work predominantly with Thoroughbreds that are done racing.&nbsp; We receive most of our horses through private donation, but do go to Sugarcreek, OH and New Holland, PA to auctions to save others from slaughter when we have extra funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also home to twenty cats and three kittens,&nbsp;some of which are in need of new, forever homes.&nbsp; There are a number of cats in our feline sanctuary on the property that cannot be rehomed for various reasons.&nbsp; Please visit our web site and see the work we have done and continue to do with the help of caring people like you.&nbsp; None of our staff is paid.&nbsp; We are all volunteers and all monies taken in go directly toward the care of the horses and cats.&nbsp; If you'd like to help, please consider a donation to our hay supplier, our feed supplier, or you can make a tax deductible contribution for us to buy a horse at auction, or you can make a general contribution to help us care for the horses we have at our facility waiting for homes.&nbsp; We have many photos on our site of horses and cats that have found homes, as well as those that are waiting for the right person to find them and give them a new home.&nbsp; Our web site is brightfuturesfarm.org&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for caring.&nbsp;
