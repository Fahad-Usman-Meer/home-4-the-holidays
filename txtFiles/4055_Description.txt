<p><strong>Barks of Love is the only non-profit canine rescue program in Orange County committed to matching dogs with ideal foster families that will give them the best chance at permanent, loving homes.</strong><br />
<br />
Since our inception in 2008, we&#39;ve maintained our values as an organization that puts our dogs&#39; welfare first. &nbsp;Everything we do is driven by our passion for matching families with the right dog. &nbsp;We emphasize compatibility and build mutually beneficial relationships to ensure dogs are placed responsibly and given a permanent home. &nbsp;We do everything we can to provide foster families with the right resources and advice to raise happy, loving dogs. &nbsp;In addition, we make continuous efforts to stay in touch with our families and follow the success of our canines.<br />
<br />
Our status as a volunteer organization ensures that our most dedicated staff have an utmost passion for rescuing and caring for dogs. &nbsp; We make sure to share all of our combined knowledge to make the most out of a foster or ownership transition.<br />
<br />
Barks of Love is one of the few animal rescue organizations to take a proactive approach in ensuring the welfare of our dogs. &nbsp;We manage the entire foster process from selection, to training, to matching the dog with a permanent family. &nbsp;Once dogs are adopted, we encourage new owners to keep in touch with any questions or concerns. &nbsp;We want our dogs to stay in one permanent home for the rest of their lives and do everything in our power to ensure that they do.<br />
<br />
Barks of Love has a diverse base of remote volunteers. &nbsp;We do not run out of a facility, but through our loving foster homes. &nbsp;Our mobile events and recruiting methods spread our ideology that anyone can take part in animal rescue across Orange County, California.</p>
