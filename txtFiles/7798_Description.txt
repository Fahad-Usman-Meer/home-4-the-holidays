<p>Hinsdale Humane Society was founded in 1953.&nbsp; We are a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to the care and adoption of homeless animals.&nbsp; We advocate education and public service to encourage the compassionate treatment of animals and to prevent their suffering and neglect.&nbsp; We are a voice for companion animals who are dependent on people for their care and believe they are entitled to our respect and protection.</p>
