Labor Of Love is a cat/dog rescue group but we do mostly cats. We also TNR feral cats to stop the over population and help reduce the overwhelming  number of cats euthanized each year. We do adoptions every Saturday and Sunday at the Petco in Wesley Chapel. We are always in desperate need of volunteers and cat food donations. <br />
