<strong>Second Chance Center for Animals (SCCA)</strong> rescues adoptable companion animals from the euthanasia lists of regional shelters and rescue&nbsp;groups, including those on Native American lands. We then find &quot;forever homes&quot; for these animals. <br />
<strong>SCCA&nbsp;</strong>also offers behavior and training classes as well as humane education&nbsp;programs throughout communities in Northern Arizona.
