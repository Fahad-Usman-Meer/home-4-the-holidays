<p><font face="Arial">Our mission is to provide loving care for German Shepherds, while finding them permanent homes that can offer them the love they need and deserve. We provide temporary housing, medical treatment, and of course LOVE! We are currently looking for foster homes, permanent homes, and any other help you may have to offer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Many of our animals come to us either abused or neglect. So in order to provide them with a loving home we have created the following adoption process. The adoption process includes an adoption application, home visit with your family and pets, and adoption contract. The adoption fee ranges from $175 to $250 depending on your location in New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. This fee helps to cover the dogs spay/neuter, microchip, vaccinations, and medical treatment.</font></p>
