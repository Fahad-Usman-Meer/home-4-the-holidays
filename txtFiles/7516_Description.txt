A Time To Live is a shelter support group that stands beside the Clark Co. Animal Shelter in Winchester, KY by helping with the needs of the shelter animals. Our volunteers are focusing on decreasing the shelter's population by placing animals in reputable rescues or responsible forever homes.  Volunteers organize events that raise public awareness of the adoptable homeless animals at the shelter.  Volunteers work with rescues and transport shelter animals.  ALL fundraising funds go toward helping the Clark Co. shelter animals.
