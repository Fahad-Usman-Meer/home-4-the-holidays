<p>Founded in 2000, MEOW Foundation is a specialized cat-focused registered charity and humane society with a no-kill mandate. We rescue and facilitate the adoption of stray and abandoned cats into new, loving permanent homes. We work hard to ensure that each MEOW cat is matched with the best possible home based on his or her personality, history, habits and individual needs.</p>

<p>In addition to our Rescue and Adoption program, MEOW Foundation offers a subsidized Spay/Neuter Assistance Program (SNAP), Cat Food Assistance Program and Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) Program for cats living in the Calgary community. MEOW Foundation also offers cat care information and spay/neuter education to the public to promote responsible pet ownership and reduce the problem of pet overpopulation.</p>

<p>Our volunteers and staff are passionate about providing the best care to every cat and dedicated to providing the best services to our supporters. We believe that through the dedication and compassion of people across the planet, we will create a society that respects the animals with whom we share the world. Together we can Make Each One Wanted.</p>
