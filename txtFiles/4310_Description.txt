<p>Mission Statement<br />
Happy Paws Rescue Inc. is a New Jersey non-profit corporation dedicated to animal rescue and adoption. We specialize in the rescue of dogs and cats from high-kill shelters where the prospect of permanent placement is unlikely. We also serve as an educational resource for the public regarding the prevention of cruelty to animals, in addition to spay and neuter awareness to reduce the population of homeless and stray dogs and cats.&nbsp; By working with committed volunteers and veterinarians, we provide all dogs and cats in our care with medical attention and a safe haven prior to placement in their permanent, loving homes.</p>
