<p>Danny &amp; Ron&#39;s Rescue is a 501(C)(3) non-profit, no-kill rescue dedicated to saving and helping dogs in need. We are based in Camden, SC and Wellington, FL.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to adoption, all rescue dogs are loved and cared for in our private home and farm as well as in approved foster homes.&nbsp; Our rescue facility is not open to the public, but by appointment only to pre-approved adopters.</p>

<p>Partners Danny Robertshaw &amp; Ron Danta have been saving and rescuing dogs for years and officially founded their rescue in 2005 after learning about the animals left homeless after Hurricane Katrina. To-date over 8,200 dogs have been placed in loving homes!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your donations pay for food, medical care, spay, neuter, supplies, and housing for these adorable dogs. It will also assist those who cannot afford medical help for their own pets. Many of our dogs are considered unadoptable due to age or chronic medial problems. They rely on the support of generous donors to defray the cost of their medical expenses. If you can&#39;t adopt a dog, please consider sponsoring a dog in need.</p>
