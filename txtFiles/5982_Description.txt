<p>We are a 501(c)(3) non profit organization. This means that your donations are tax deductible.</p>
<p>We have an article in our weekly paper the Clearwater Tribune under Clearwater Humane Society News. We use this article to educate the public about pet care and also tell wonderful adoption stories. We list, at no cost to the owner, lost dogs &amp; cats in order to help the pets get back home.</p>
<p>We speak at different organizations like Rotary and at schools to help educate the public on what we do.</p>
<p>We are aggressive about persuing cruelty and neglect cases in our county. Trooper is our mascot. He came to us 6 years ago as a 5 month old puppy. His owner had bashed his front leg with a baseball bat. Trooper had to have a huge surgery at Washington State University. His leg will always be 3 inches shorter than the other front leg. He is a gentle happy dog that will always be with us. Trooper loves all the puppies and kittens we have.</p>
<p>We spay and neuter all animals that are for adoption. They are also vaccinated. Any medical issues a dog or cat might come to us with are taken care of before adoption. We have had dogs and cats come to us that have been run over by cars, starved, and have had various illnesses. All are treated. We also spay, neuter, and vaccinate owned dogs &amp; cats at either low cost or no cost to the owners in order to reduce the general&nbsp;pet population.</p>
<p>We are all volunteer. Please donate to help us carry on helping the helpless.</p>
