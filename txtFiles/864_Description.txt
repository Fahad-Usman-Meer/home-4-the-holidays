<h3>Foundation for Animals In Risk</h3>
<p>FAIR started around March of 1995. A couple of volunteers working at an adoption center for Pima Animal Care Center (PACC) grew tired of sending the unadopted animals back to die. In an effort to buy them more time, the volunteers started stashing animals in their own homes and those of other volunteers. </p>
<p>The volunteers quickly grew in number and on April 26, 1996, they incorporated. Two years later, on December 1, 1998, FAIR was recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a Section 501(c)(3), tax-exempt organization. FAIR is also proud to comply with the national no-kill standards. </p>
