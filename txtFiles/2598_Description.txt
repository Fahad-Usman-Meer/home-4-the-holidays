<p>We are a group of volunteers helping our local municipal&nbsp;Coos County animal shelter and the animals in our community. FOCCAS provides to the animal shelter&nbsp;vaccines, worming, flea treatments, medication and medical treatment for some adoptable animals. As of this year 2013 we are also funding the Science Diet Food program they&nbsp;offer animal shelters. The FOCCAS animals come from the shelter, owner surrender or stray cats.&nbsp;Our foster program helps to reduce euthanasia of dogs or puppies and&nbsp;cats or kittens at the shelter. Over&nbsp;2300 animals in the past eight years have found forever homes because of&nbsp;our volunteers. All the dogs or cats have been spayed or neutered, also helping to reduce the pet overpopulation in this area. We have a Community Outreach Program where if, funding allows, we can offer to help pay all or part of a low income families spay or neuter cost. With extra dog or cat food donations we give to the local food banks/animal rescues so they can give to families in need. The people who feed at the feral cat colonies need food and we provide them extra food when we get donations. We can only do this because of the generousity in this community from the veterinarians who&nbsp;help us with our medical needs to the children who put in their last quarter into our donation jar. We thank them all.</p>
