New Hope Dog Rescue (NHDR) will foster stray, abandoned, neglected, unwanted, and abused dogs and re-home them. NHDR members will strive to find the right home best suited to an individual dog. We will not place dogs simply as a means to move them out. NH defines a &ldquo;good&rdquo; home as one that is a match for the dog&rsquo;s temperament, energy level and training requirements. A good home must meet both the physical and psychological needs of the dog. <br />
<br />
NHDR strives to educate the public on humane treatment, lifelong commitment, responsible dog ownership, and population control through spaying and neutering. NHDR is a registered non-profit organization. All the money raised goes directly to the dogs! <br />
