<p>The Second Chance Sato Rescue of Temple NH, is a growing group of dedicated individuals (would you like to join us?) in the Hillsborough County Area who have chosen to work exclusively with Second Chance Animal Rescue to find homes for &quot;Sato's&quot; (Puerto Rican slang for Street/Stray Dogs and pronounced &quot;saw-toe&quot;) who are awaiting their &quot;second chance&quot;. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sato's tend to be mostly small to medium dogs, although you will find some of a larger size. Upon arrival, many are initially very shy and timid, but once they realize that life is good in New Hampshire and that they are no longer in jeopardy, their happy and true personalities surface as they settle in and begin to relax. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are a NH-Non Profit organization licensed through the State of NH Department of Agriculture and are located in Temple, NH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We are a &quot;foster home&quot; shelter, so all dogs in our care are living with families in the area which gives us the opportunity to best understand their personality within a home environment, allowing us to best match them with the proper family. Once a dog reaches our rescue, our foster home families and Director of Adoptions begin searching for the perfect match - a family who is &quot;just right&quot; and will give the pet a wonderful home. While waiting for their forever home, our dogs receive the best of care while in the 48 hour quarantine and with their foster familes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;All dogs have been spayed/neutered, and come fully vaccinated (DHLPP series, rabies, and bordatella), heartworm-tested based on age, and have been dewormed and on heartworm preventative. Each dog is seen by a local veterinarian the day before making their journey, and then see a licensed NH Veterinarian for a State of NH Health Certificate before they are adopted (compliance of NH Department of Agriculture regulations). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We work exclusively with Second Chance Animal Rescue located in Villalba, Puerto Rico to find homes for stray dogs they have rescued. They are a no kill, non-profit organization founded to help improve the quality of life of the animals in Puerto Rico dedicated toward improving the basic care and safety of the animals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As members of The Puerto Rican Federation of Animal Protectors, they work in conjunction with other organizations to achieve their common goals to help those that can't help themselves. Their Mission is dedicated to the safety and well being of the animals. They rescue animals that are neglected, abused, abandoned or unwanted by their owners. A typical rescue includes a trip to the veterinarian for a complete health check-up which includes vaccinations, worming, heartworm check and spay or neuter. If there is a more serious condition they go the extra mile. At S.C.A.R, they rehabilitate the physically and emotionally distressed soul and find a good home that meets the requirements of Second Chance Animal Rescue both within Puerto Rico and the United States.</p>
