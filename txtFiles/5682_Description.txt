<p><strong>DCH Animal Adoptions</strong> is a volunteer run animal rescue charity who rescues and rehomes Dogs, Cats and Horses from Sydney pounds. </p>
<p>We work with a system of volunteer foster carers who house our pets in their own homes until a permanent home comes along. This allows us to assess the animals in a home situation and therefore match you up with the most suitable pet for you. </p>
<p>We have carers throughout Sydney, Wollongong and the Central Coast of NSW. If you'd like to adopt a pet through us, or help us in any way with our charity work then please contact us.</p>
