<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">The Maryland SPCA is a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to helping animals and people. We are not affiliated with any other animal organization, and we do not receive any government funding. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">The Maryland SPCA helps all pets &ndash; including elderly, sick, feral, or aggressive ones. We believe that every pet deserves our compassion and help, especially the pets who have serious health or behavior problems. These pets are the ones who need us the most, and it is our mission to do our best for them, just as we help the very adoptable pets that any shelter would welcome.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Because we accept all pets, we must euthanize animals who are a danger to people, cannot live in a home, or who are very sick or elderly. Euthanasia is a heart-breaking task that is necessary for pets who cannot be placed in homes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">We work hard to prevent euthanasia and to keep animals in homes. We offer a variety of educational programs to help people learn the best way to care for their pets. And, we help pet owners by telephone or email with questions and problems with their pets to prevent people from giving up their pets.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Animals who are placed up for adoption at the SPCA remain in the program as long as they remain healthy and friendly. While most pets are adopted within a few days, some stay with us for a few weeks before finding a new home. The staff at the SPCA works hard to find loving, new homes for all the animals, including giving some of the pets basic training and enrichment to ensure a smooth transition in their new homes.</font> <br />
