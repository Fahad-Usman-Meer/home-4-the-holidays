North Carolina Pekingese Rescue is dedicated to finding permanent loving homes for Pekingese dogs that are in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also work with only rescues in promoting education to the community about animal health &amp; animal needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We take in more then just Pekingese.&nbsp;&nbsp; We try to help with any dog or cat in need and take in any breed or mixed breed dog that we can help to place in a permanent loving forever home.&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that it is our responsibility as God's children to help all animals.
