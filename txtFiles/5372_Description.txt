<p>In June, 2008, we began Kingdom Kats working with a small network of foster homes and an adoption center out of Morrisons Feed Bag in St J.&nbsp; We successfully placed over 75 cats and kittens into wonderful new homes.&nbsp; We are in the process of opening our own cat adoption center at 1664 Memorial Drive, St Johnsbury Center as a limited-access facility.</p>
