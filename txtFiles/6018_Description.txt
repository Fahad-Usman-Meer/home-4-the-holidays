<div>The mission of the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region is to prevent animal cruelty and neglect, and promote a responsible community where animals are inherently valued and owners are committed to their pets.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Founded in 1949, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region is a private, non-profit animal welfare organization dedicated to the care and protection of domesticated animals in our community. The Humane Society rescues and cares for animals in distress, re-unites lost pets with their owners, finds loving permanent homes for homeless animals, teaches people how to properly care for and respect animals as well as enforces licensing and other animal ordinances. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On average, more than 23,000 animals pass through the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region's doors annually: lost pets, injured animals, rescued animals, and surrendered animals. Thanks to the support of many individuals, contracts and fees, the Humane Society is able to make a huge difference in the lives of those who cannot speak for themselves,&nbsp;the abandoned&nbsp;pets of our community.</div>
