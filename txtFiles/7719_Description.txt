<div class="data_field">At Paws for Life, our mission is to rescue loving pet quality dogs from death row at area animal shelters. These dogs are scheduled for euthanasia simply because of lack of space. We provide proper medical care, a loving environment, and whatever time it takes for a dog to find a forever home. We believe that man&rsquo;s best friend deserves nothing less than our very best.</div>
