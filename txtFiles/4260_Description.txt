Under the direction of the Animal Control Officer, Liz Botelho, and with the&nbsp;aid of&nbsp;a group of dedicated volunteers, &nbsp;the Swansea Animal Shelter provides care and shelter to an annual census of 175-200 stray and lost animals.&nbsp; Happily, 85-90% were returned to their owners or found new safe and loving homes.&nbsp; Dedicated to the belief that all life has value, the Swansea Animal Shelter looks forward to providing a safe and caring environment for all that pass through its doors.
