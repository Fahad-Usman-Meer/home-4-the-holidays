<p>The Pet Adoption Connection is an all volunteer, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. We are a small group dedicated to the rescue and placement of unwanted or abandoned dogs and cats. We foster the animals in our own homes until they are placed in new permanent homes (we do NOT have a kennel facility). All animals are healthy, spayed or neutered, vaccinated, wormed, etc. before they are released from us. We do not kennel our animals,all the animals in our program are cared for in foster homes and therefore we know their temperament, personalities, likes and dislikes, thus helping us to match them with their new families.</p>
