Who are we?

The Annex Cat Rescue began as a group of volunteers living primarily in the Annex neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We now have members from all over the city. We share a common bond -- a love of cats and concern for their welfare. We are a non-profit organization and have no government funding.

It is our goal to eliminate cruelty to animals by providing for the fostering and adoption of cats that are homeless, abandoned, or where their owners (through illness, age, or death) can no longer care for them. We try to educate members of our community regarding the proper care of cats and to provide information aimed at reducing the feral, homeless, and abandoned populations. Throughout the year, we assist in the feeding of many feral cat colonies.
