<p>We have a wonderful quality of life - no kill facility that at any given time has 25-45 dogs and 20-50 cats. We have a small but amazing staff as well as amazing volunteers who help to&nbsp;ensure our animals get the love,&nbsp;attention and training they need and deserve until their forever family&nbsp;is found.&nbsp;</p>
