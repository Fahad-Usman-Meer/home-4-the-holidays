<p>CK Animal Rescue is a registered non profit animal rescue organization comprised of dedicated animal lovers who volunteer their time, vehicles, fuel and open their hearts and homes to caring for our rescue dogs.<br />
<br />
Many of our rescues were dogs scheduled to be euthanized in high kill shelters as well as local owner surrenders. Our foster families are the backbone of our organization, they give our furry rescues all the time and love they need to realize being a dog is fun!<br />
<br />
Permanent loving homes are found through our home visit/adoption program. Be sure to visit our Happy Endings page!</p>
