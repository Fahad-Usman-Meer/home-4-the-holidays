<p align="center"><font face="georgia" size="3"><font face="Tahoma">The purpose of this endeavor is to aid unfortunate animals in the interest of a higher quality of life. We take in rescued, confiscated, neglected, injured, ill, unmanageable, or otherwise unwanted animals from private owners, zoos, shelters, and other public organizations. These animals are cared for, and/or rehabilitated to the best of our ability and means until which time they can be found healthy, happy homes - whether it be through adoption to qualified candidates or legally released into habitats suitable to the specific species in conjunction with licensed wildlife rehabilitators. </font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="georgia" size="3"><font face="Tahoma">Please visit our website for more information and links to our Petfinder&nbsp;and&nbsp; MySpace pages. You can call Sean to schedule a visit with any of our pets up for adoption. </font></font></p>
