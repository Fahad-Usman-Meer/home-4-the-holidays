<p>We are a&nbsp;small, mostly private foster homes adoption agency. We specialize in Siberian Huskies.&nbsp;We have contacts outside of West Virginia to help Re-Home and find Siberian Huskies. We will help other breeds and mixes when we have room, and cats and small furies as well as some barnyard pets.To contact us please use email, this will get the quickest response : cinniwolf@yahoo.com .&nbsp;</p>

<p>Siberians are beautiful active working dogs, PLEASE read about the breed before you buy or adopt. You as the human part of this team, are responsible for understanding the Heritage of the Breed you choose, and adjust YOUR lifestyle to accommodate it.</p>

<p>Siberians respond BEST to Positive Training, do not ever ever HIT your Siberian. it will not train them, it will make them not trust you.</p>

<p>If you do not like dog fur on your clothing, car, furniture, food - FIND ANOTHER BREED. Siberian have two coats, an outer coat of long guard hairs that shed every day, and an undercoat of wool like fur that sheds (we call it &quot;blowing coat&quot; at least twice a year. Think mountains of fur - think more fur than Sax Fifth&nbsp;Avenue. YOU are the one responsible to keep these coats cleaned out and brushed out so they can do their job - protect the dog from cold and sun &amp; heat!</p>

<p>Siberians are escape artists. They need a safe enclosed area to run in when off leash - this can be a backyard - or - a nice dog park, or even running, biking with you. They are &nbsp;a working breed and WANT to work. Don&#39;t believe it? Watch the eyes of the dogs at the start of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race, they are CRAZY to run! If they do not get enough exercise, that CRAZY will turn destructive, on your stuff!</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE spay and neuter your pets</strong>. Dog of both genders not altered will wander in search of love, risking death by car, train, bus, or dog fight. Females are more likely to develop breast cancer in middle years if not spayed, males are more likely to develop&nbsp;testicular&nbsp;cancer. ALL of the pets here are spayed or neutered before adoption.</p>

<p>There are too many pure bred Dogs of all Kinds in shelters, dying every day - because there are not enough good homes to go around, enough good people who are willing to learn and understand the breed. This, sadly, is true for all breeds and mix breed too.</p>

<p><strong>THANK YOU for considering ADOPTION</strong> - <em><strong>you are saving TWO lives, the wonderful new pet you take home, and making room for another out of a kill shelter!</strong></em></p>
