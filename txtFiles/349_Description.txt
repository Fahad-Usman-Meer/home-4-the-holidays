<p>Angel&rsquo;s Wish is dedicated to reducing animal overpopulation,                    rehoming companion animals, and raising awareness of animal                welfare issues in South Central Wisconsin.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Lois Lawrence, a founding member of Angel's Wish, once rescued                    a kitten from a construction site. Weak with starvation, dehydration,                    and a severe upper respiratory infection, neither veterinary                    treatment nor Lois&rsquo; love and care could save the kitten                    from the effects of that hot June day. Angel died that night                    in Lois' arms. We believe that Angel's Wish would have been                    that no other animal be subjected to pain, suffering, abandonment                or neglect.</p>

<br />
<p>We                    divert animals from ever arriving at area shelters, and as                    space allows, assist rescue groups and shelters. We accept                    only animals we have space to care for, and euthanize only                    for severe medical or temperament reasons. Animals stay in                    their current home or are cared for in volunteer foster homes                until adoptive homes are found.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Before                    any Angel&rsquo;s Wish animal is placed in a new home, he                    or she is spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and treated for                    parasites and any known medical concerns. Cats are tested                    for FeLV/FIV; dogs are tested for heartworm and are microchipped.                    Upon adoption, all animals are eligible for one month of complimentary                    ShelterCare Pet Insurance. 100% of adoption fees are applied                to animal medical care.</p>

<br />
<p>Our                    volunteer foster homes get to know their fostered animals                    well and understand their personalities&mdash;allowing us                    to make great matches between people and pets! Let us know                    about your family situation, current pets, and the type of                    pet you are looking for and we can guide you to animals that                would be a great match.</p>
