<p>All Creatures Great and Small Animal Rescue<br />
is located in Hollister, California. <br />
It was founded in 1999 by Vivian Kennedy. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
Our primary function is to assist our local Shelter in retrieving animals that would otherwise be euthanized, due to lack of space or special-needs veterinary care. <br />
All our pets are raised in loving foster home environments, making them more adoptable. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
We advocate the spaying and neutering of all pets, and try to educate those who do not understand the implications of not altering their pets. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
We encourage the public to participate in our spay/neuter program for feral cats, thus saving the lives of these often unwanted cats and kittens. </p>
<p>All Creatures Great and Small Animal Rescue is a strong and vigilant advocate in the Rights for All Animals. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
We believe that by working with other rescue organizations, we can save lives, by retrieving more animals from surrounding Shelters. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
