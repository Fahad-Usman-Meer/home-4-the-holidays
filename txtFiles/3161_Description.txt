<p>Yavapai Humane Society was founded in 1972 by a group of concerned animal lovers. Over forty years later we are still providing compassionate care to animals that find themselves homeless providing medical treatment to injured and abused animals, we also offer helpful programs and services to the pet owners of Yavapai County including low cost spay/neuter efforts, low cost vaccination clinics, and a local Thrift Store from which proceeds benefit the animals.</p>

<p>Annually, Yavapai Humane&nbsp;Society&nbsp;finds more than 3,000 homeless pets their forever families and has&nbsp;achieved the status as the safest animal shelter in Arizona, and among the highest in our country, with a lifesaving rate of 97%.</p>

<p>The Yavapai Humane Society relies on generous donations from animal lovers to maintain our lifesaving successes. Financial support from friends of the animals allows us to continue to provide exceptional programs and services to the homeless pet population in our community.</p>
