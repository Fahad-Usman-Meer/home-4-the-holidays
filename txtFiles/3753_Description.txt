<p>LIFE for Pets is a non-profit 501c3 orginization based in Clark County, dedicated in giving homeless animals a chance for a better life by rescuing, fostering and adopting into forever loving homes.&nbsp; We are a group of volunteers concerned about pet overpopulation and educating the public on the importance of spaying and neutering.&nbsp; We are funded solely by donations and fundraising efforts and could not save these precious animals without your support.</p>
<p>LIFE for Pets goal is to eventually do away with the need for unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable animals at our local shelter.&nbsp; We have already successfully campaigned to get legislation in place requiring every animal to be&nbsp;altered before it is adopted.&nbsp; As a result of pet overpopulation there is an abundance of suffering stray animals on our streets searching for shelter, their next meal, or sadly, dying needlessly from various diseases or accidents.&nbsp; it is our prayer that more pet owners will see the need in having their pets altered which will help us in our efforts to save these furry companions.</p>
