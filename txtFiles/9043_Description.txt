<h2>We Help Animals Find Forever Homes through Animal Adoptions</h2>

<p>We strive to keep a broad selection of cats and dogs, kittens and puppies on-site giving visitors a variety of sizes, colors, ages, and fur lengths to select from. Animals at the facility are available for adoption on a first-come first-serve basis. All animals adopted through the FHS are spayed/neutered as a condition of adoption.</p>

<p>Our staff and phone volunteers counsel families regarding animal adoption. We help families understand the financial cost of owning a pet as well as the time commitment required. We counsel families to understand the potential dangers of matching young kittens with young toddlers, or the danger of giving a pet as a gift to an unknowing individual. Additionally we provide resource information on a variety of topics including: crate training, house breaking, barking, jumping, nutrition, grooming, and exercise, to name just a few.</p>
