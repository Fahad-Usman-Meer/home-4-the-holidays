<h3>Little Mews Rescue</h3>

<p>Little Mews&nbsp;is an all volunteer, non profit, 501(c)3, no-kill rescue organization&nbsp;located in Chenango County NY. We take in cats and kittens from a variety of situations, most are stray, unwanted, neglected&nbsp;or abused.&nbsp;We&nbsp;can also&nbsp;refer you to other&nbsp;organizations in the area that have dogs, cats and other animals for adoption,&nbsp;and have information about low cost spay and neuter options.</p>

<p>All our cats and kittens who are&nbsp;ready for adoption have been checked by a vet, vaccinated for FVRCP, rabies (if over 4 months), tested for Feline Leukemia, FIV, wormed, and spayed/neutered if old enough. Any health conditions are treated so that the cats can be adopted as healthy as possible. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our cats don&#39;t live in shelter cages, they&#39;re cared for in&nbsp;family homes with&nbsp;lots&nbsp;of love and attention. They&#39;re socialized with other cats and large friendly dogs. We try to get them to adapt to normal family life so they&#39;ll be ready to&nbsp;settle in&nbsp;to their&nbsp;new homes quickly. Since the cats and kittens live in a home, not a shelter cage, we can take the time to know each cat individually. We know which ones are shy or outgoing, who is the most playful, or the most quiet. Because we know the personality of each cat and kitten, we&#39;re able to match you with one that will fit your lifestyle the best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our&nbsp;goal&nbsp;is to find safe, healthy, forever homes for cats and to promote spay/neuter so that the number of unwanted cats is lowered every year. We want each cat and kitten adopted to a home where it will live forever and promise to take back any who are unable to remain&nbsp;with you, at any time, for any reason.</p>

<p>We ask for an adoption donation, which is&nbsp; used to help cover the cost of veterinary care and may vary depending on the age and special needs of the cat/kitten.&nbsp;&nbsp; We spay and neuter all older kittens and adult cats before they are adopted and that will be included in the adoption fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is spay/neuter assistance available for low income families if needed, through the state or local organizations.</p>

<p>On occasion we&#39;ll list cats (or even a dog or two)&nbsp;as a courtesy to others who need to find new homes for their pets, and can help arrange adoption for you. If you need to find a new home for your cat or find yourself with unwanted kittens, we&#39;ll help you find homes for them.</p>

<p>Foster homes are always needed to help care for the cats and kittens until they can find permanent homes. If you&#39;d like to foster a litter of kittens or adult cats, please let us know.</p>

<p>Our non-profit, no-kill organization depends on your generous donations. Every&nbsp;penny of the donations goes towards caring for the cats and kittens to provide veterinary care, good food, supplies and whatever else they need.</p>
