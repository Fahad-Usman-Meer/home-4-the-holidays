            <td class="text-11px" valign="top" align="left"><font size="2">Welcome to Carolina Poodle Rescue Carolina Poodle Rescue is a no-kill/limited entry private rescue group; we believe and support the No More Homeless Pets and spay/neuter initiatives. All animals adopted from Carolina Poodle are spayed or neutered before being placed. We provide sanctuary and rehabilitation and, when the right home comes along, rehome poodles and other needy small dogs. We maintain a waiting list of homes and most of our animals are placed from this list. Our efforts are funded solely through adoption fees and donations. There are no paid staff - all volunteers give their time and talents because of a desire to assist dogs in need. Please note - we have two firm rules. 1. We do not adopt our pets to homes where children under 5 years old live 2. We do not adopt standard poodles to homes that do not have physical fences (underground or electronic fences are not considered sufficient). </font></td>

It describes our screening process and tells what you can expect as we review your application. We are as much sanctuary as shelter, and our animals are only placed when we are as sure as we can be that the new home is the last and permanent home for this pet. In addition, our research shows that animals and homes that are thoroughly screened and matched make better permanent relationships between the pet and the family. Carolina Poodle Rescue is staffed by experienced volunteers who are also dog owners. Our dogs are maintained in foster homes until a suitable permanent home can be found. We know our dogs very well. Unlike most shelters, we have an excellent success rate with our adoptions. Fewer than 2% of our placements are returned due to incompatibility. This is a tribute to our diligence in screening potential homes as well as the skill of our volunteers. Though you may apply for a particular dog, please allow our adoption counselors to advise and guide you in the selection of your next companion. Our adoption process is extensive. Your answers will be reviewed and your vet and/or groomer and personal references will be contacted. Should we not receive a positive report, you will be contacted by e-mail and given the opportunity to correct the information we have been given. Once references are approved, you will be contacted by phone for an extensive interview. If that step is approved, you will be visited in your home by a CPR rescue volunteer. In addition, we retain the right to conduct follow up visits at one week, one month, six months and annually. We retain the right to refuse any adoption. CPR charges adoption fees that vary with each dog. Adoption fees are posted on petfinder in the description of each animal. Rescue and rehabilitation efforts are funded solely through adoption fees and donations. We receive no public funds. We do not euthanize. Once an animal has been accepted into CPR, it will be cared for throughout its natural life and it is always welcome to return here. In fact, our contract will require that you return the dog to CPR if you can no longer care for him or her, no matter what the reason. Thanks - looking forward to hearing from you.
