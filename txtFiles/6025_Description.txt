<em>The Rappahannock Animal Welfare League runs the daily operations of the County Shelter. We are a non euthanizing for space facility who cares for our dogs 365 days and nights a year. All of our animals are fully vetted regardless of their adoption status and stay in our care until a proper home is found.</em>
