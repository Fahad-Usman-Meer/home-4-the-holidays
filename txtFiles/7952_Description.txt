<p>Wags and Whiskers Rescue is a non-profit 501c3 dedicated to saving animals from high kill shelters. All of our pets go through a foster process to assist them in the transition from shelter life to home life! In 2013 we opened our adoption center at 2846 Finch Road, Modesto, CA, allowing us more opportunities to showcase pets ready for their forever homes!</p>
