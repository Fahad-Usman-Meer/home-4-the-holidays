In memory of Peter Zippi, a young man dedicated to the care of animals,  The Peter Zippi 		Fund For Animals was founded in 1977 by Dr. Alice Villalobos. We have  adopted out over 12.000 pets (mostly cats) 		since then. The fund is run by wonderful volunteers who work  tirelessly to help those who can't help themselves. The fund supports spay/neuter for stray pets and adoptions for lost and  homeless animals.
