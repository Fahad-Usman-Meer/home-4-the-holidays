We speak for those who cannot.&nbsp; We rescue the abandoned, abused, neglected and those thrown away.&nbsp; We rehabilitate the &quot;special needs&quot; dogs, deemed unadoptable at Kill Shelters.&nbsp; We socialize them with humans and other dogs.&nbsp; We love them all.&nbsp; We try our best to find the perfect safe home for each of them and for those others, well they live here with us in our Sanctuary, surrounded by our beauful 7 acres and love.
