<h3>Who We Are</h3>
Huron County Humane Society was founded in 1953 by Roselle Ward, one year before the Humane Society of the United States was formed. Our mission is to provide shelter for abandonded, neglected and abused animals in Huron County. <br />
The Huron County Humane Society serves the residents of Huron County. We are a non-profit 501 (c) (3) organization overseen by a Board of Directors. Monies funding Huron County Humane Society are from private contributions, membership dues and fundraising efforts of the Board of Directors and Volunteers.
