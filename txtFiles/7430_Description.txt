<p>Sweetpups is a no-kill, non-profit, all breed dog rescue based in Vidor, TX.&nbsp; We pull dogs from high-kill shelters in the area, get them completely vetted (including spayed/neutered), and adopt them to loving homes.</p>
<p>In our first year of operation (July 2010 - June 2011) we saved over 300 lives from certain death.</p>
<p>Sweetpups is a shelter based organization, meaning that a majority of the dogs are housed in one location.&nbsp; However, we are always looking for qualified, loving foster homes.</p>
<p>Sweetpups operates on the small adoption fees we charge and the donations we receive.</p>
