Furry Friends Pet Rescue rescues companion animals from high kill  shelters. They are then placed in loving foster homes until the right  forever home is found. We are a 501 (c) (3) Non Profit organization.<br />
We are a group of volunteers dedicated to saving companion animals from  high kill situations in NY and out of state. We are located in the  Southern Dutchess County, NY area. All of our animals are fully vetted,  spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.
