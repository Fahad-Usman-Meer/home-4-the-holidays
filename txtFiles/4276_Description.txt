<p>Founded in 1994, MAAN, the Michigan Animal Adoption Network, is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization for animal rescue in the Metro Detroit area. We frequently engage in special promotions and fundraising efforts. The Network is always looking for new and different ways to educate the public, to raise money to continue its rescue efforts, and to find loving homes for homeless pets. The Network has grown tremendously in the last several years, and continues to do so, hoping to one day make it so all rescue groups work together to help animals. </p>
<p>First and foremost among the two operations of the Michigan Animal Adoption Network is our Animal Care Network (ACN), a dedicated group of volunteers spending time each weekend in low income areas in suburban Wayne and Oakland counties providing relief to strictly outdoor pets. </p>

<p>The difference that the ACN has made in the many neighborhoods they visit is phenomenal. Volunteers are not only dedicated to rescuing the animals but are also committed to rehabilitating. The ACN could not be prouder of the hard work of our volunteers and the results of this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ACN has been active for over 15 years. The program consists of staff and volunteers that team up to venture into neighborhoods in search of animals in need. The ACN has become a well-known source of assistance and advice for thousands of citizens in the area and is considered a place for many pet workers to come to for help. In fact, our low cost spay neuter program always has a waiting list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every weekend and many evenings, the teams load up with supplies, including doghouses, straw, food and water to take to the neighborhoods. The ACN will act on complaints but the real objective is to rescue, assist, spay or neuter and educate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program has a few stipulations. If pet owners insist on keeping their animals outdoors, the ACN will provide new dog houses if owners are willing to spay/neuter their dogs or cats (at low cost!). The response to this has been overwhelming. Since 1994 over 2,835 cats and dogs have been sterilized within the Metro area alone. This has resulted in a huge decrease in the number of unwanted litters and strays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the ACN comes across a litter of puppies or kittens we will offer to spay the mother for free if the litter is surrendered to the ACN. This has been a very successful part of the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the conditions are severe, ACN will attempt to rescue the animal(s) in need. A bad situation will not be forgotten of unresolved. </p>
