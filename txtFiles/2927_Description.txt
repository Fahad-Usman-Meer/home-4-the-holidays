Feline Rescue &amp; Rehome (FuRR) is a 501(c)3 non-profit cat rescue organization based in central Arkansas.&nbsp; FuRR began in early 2002 and is totally 100% volunteer, including the Board of Directors.<br />
FuRR is a foster home based, no time limit, no kill organization which practices TNR for feral cats, removes kittens from feral colonies when possible to tame &amp; adopt out as pets.&nbsp; FuRR rescues abused, abandoned, neglected cats &amp; kittens which would otherwise be euthanized in city shelters.<br />
FuRR also assists feline families with vet bills for seriously injured &amp; sick cats who cannot afford high vet costs, with the goal of keeping cats in thier homes.<br />
FuRR is listed on PetFinder and we show cats for adoption on most weekends at PetCo and PetSmart.&nbsp; Check us out at www.TeamFuRR.org today!
