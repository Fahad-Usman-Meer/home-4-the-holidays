            <br />
            For nearly 40 years, the Cheyenne Animal Shelter has extended the hand of kindness to neglected and abused companion animals in Cheyenne and Laramie County.&nbsp; Today, we are involved in an ever-expanding effort to accomplish a mission that goes beyond sheltering the homeless and unwanted pet population.&nbsp; Our goal is to find a home for every adoptable companion animal brought to our door.&nbsp; To reach this goal, we must increase the number of pets we place and decrease the number of pets relinquished.&nbsp; We hope to achieve this goal through ongoing community relations programs, such as humane education, offsite adoptions and outreach. <br />
