<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="http://www.upaws.org/images/shelter.png" style="float:right; height:133px; width:200px" />Our mission is to improve the quality of life and welfare for domestic animals and to provide a safe haven while finding lifelong homes for the animals in our care.&nbsp; We embrace the No Kill philosophy, seeking to end the euthanasia of healthy and treatable animals.</p>

<h2>Our Vision</h2>

<p>A community where there are no abandoned, unwanted, neglected or abused animals, and where everyone understands and practices the level of commitment and responsibility that pet guardianship entails.</p>
