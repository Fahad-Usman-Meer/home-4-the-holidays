We are a small rescue that takes great pride in placing well and matching the right family to the right cat or dog.<br />
<br />
Currently, we have a number of rescued kittens, many sight disabled (one-eyed, the other had to be removed).&nbsp; But that sure doesn't change their spirits!&nbsp; These are happy little kittens who will add love to your life!<br />

You can see our adoptable pets on Petfinder.com and AdoptAPet.com.&nbsp;
