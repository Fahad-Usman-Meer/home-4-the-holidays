<p>Animal Shelter Volunteers of Texas support animals and staff at the Conroe Animal Adoption Center (city shelter).&nbsp; We socialize cats and dogs, seek adoptive homes, carry out off-site adoptions, &nbsp;provide foster homes, provide vet care through a local veterinarian and facilitate a transport of dogs from the shelter to a higher adoption rate shelter in Colorado.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are completely staffed by volunteers.</p>
