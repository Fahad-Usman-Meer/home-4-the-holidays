<span class="text"><strong><font size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16px; LINE-HEIGHT: 19px">We at All Creatures Rescue are dedicated to helping <br soft="" />
rescued, homeless, abandoned and unwanted animals in <br soft="" />
the SW Louisiana area.<br />
<br />
We are a volunteer only group that operates through the <br soft="" />
loving care of our foster homes. We do not have a shelter <br soft="" />
to house our rescues so we are only able to take in those <br soft="" />
who can be provided with Foster Care.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in becoming a Foster Parent please <br soft="" />
fill out a Foster Application in the &quot;Forms&quot; Section of our <br soft="" />
website! Remember that as a Foster Parent you will have <br soft="" />
the first opportunity to adopt!<br />
<br />
All of are rescues are only placed into the most secure <br soft="" />
and loving homes, nothing else will do! We specialize in <br soft="" />
the placements of our canine and feline friends but we will <br soft="" />
also assist in finding loving homes for Birds and Small <br soft="" />
Animals!<br />
<br />
Please remember that when you adopt or foster from us <br soft="" />
you are really helping to save a life of an animal in need!<br />
