Saving and bettering feline lives since 1997, SCAT Street Cat Rescue volunteers provide resources to assist cats and kittens from the streets, particularly feral cats.&nbsp; We promote the use of&nbsp;Trap-Neuter- Adopt whenever possible, particularly with kittens, but we also promote the use of Trap-Neuter-Return for feral adult cats who have a &quot;business job&quot; of rodent catching in business areas and who have shelter and caregivers.
