<p>The Hobart Cat Centre is the only specific feline shelter in Tasmania.&nbsp; Tasmania (or Tassie, as it's known) is a small island off the south coast of mainland Australia.&nbsp; As an island, we have a huge amount of unusual and unique wildlife, like the &quot;Tassie Devil&quot;...yes they do exist and they are nasty little critters!&nbsp; The Hobart Cat Centre has recently worked in conjunction with our State Government to determine and propose&nbsp;a &quot;Cat Management&quot; Legislation, which was passed through our political process in November 2009, and will be implemented and made law by July 2010.&nbsp; The basis of this, is that all domestic feline pets must be desexed and microchipped at point of sale/transfer of ownership.&nbsp; We are very proud to be a part of this, and whilst we know that in the short term our &quot;surrender&quot; numbers will be high, particularly for owned cats, we think this is the best thing to happen in Tassie for a long time.&nbsp; The next thing we need to do is get into place a Feral Cat Management plan, so that our unique wildlife can be protected.</p>
<p>On average we accept between 3000 and 4000 cats per year, and due to our very distinct climate, we have a cat breeding season over our summer months, so our &quot;kitten season&quot; runs from October through to May or thereabouts.&nbsp; It's very unusual for us to have kittens over winter, but occassionally it will happen.</p>
