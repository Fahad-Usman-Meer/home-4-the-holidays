<p><strong>Vision, Mission and Objective of HappyPaws Haven in Grafton</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our Vision</strong> is to provide a safe haven for abandoned animals, to nurse them to health both physically and mentally and to give them the opportunity to gain the tools to enable them to find their special forever home. The centre is to be the model re-homing centre in Australia. Not only from the comfort and rehabilitation of the animals we rescue but also as an education centre to promote responsible pet owner ship, understanding domestic animal behaviour and need for de-sexing all domestic animals unless you are a registered breeder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The animal haven is not a traditional animal welfare shelter but more a rehabilitation and re-homing centre.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At HappyPaws Haven, we do not keep our beautiful animals in an antiseptic, caged atmosphere, like that found in most animal shelters and pounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dogs and cats are kept in a natural setting.</p>

<p>Our cats live in spacious insulated enclosures as colonies with access to the outside.</p>

<p>The dogs have the opportunity to roam in large grassy runs that are at least 15 metres wide by 20 metres long with insulated and lined cabins to rest in at any time.</p>

<p>There is a puppy pen and a kitten den for the babies and where possible their mothers too.</p>

<p>When an animal arrives injured or sick they are quarantined and nurtured by caring human hands back to health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newly arrived Dogs and cats are kept separated from the main population until an emotional, behavioural and psychological assessment can be made, then if all is well, they are integrated into a pack or a cattery colony.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to be the best animal rehabilitation and re-homing centre, a safe place where all animals that are accepted are given the tools to live happy healthy lives in their new homes and to educate the community in regard to the behaviour of these animals including responsible pet ownership and the importance of desexing.</p>
