<p><strong>Our Purpose</strong><br />
St. Sophia&rsquo;s Forgotten Felines is a non-profit foster-based cat rescue in Addison, IL. Established in late 2010, St. Sophia&rsquo;s strives to be the best in temporary care for cats in transition. What does this mean? It means that the cats in our care aren&rsquo;t intended to stay in our care. Our hope is a forever home for every adoptable cat &mdash; no more homeless cats!</p>

<p><strong>Our Cats</strong><br />
We work closely with local Trap-Neuter-Return organizations as well as Animal Care and Control Agencies and transfer the cats we believe are most in need. On intake, each cat or kitten undergoes the ASPCA &ldquo;Felinality&rdquo; assessment test to determine its personality and temperament. Then, each cat undergoes full medical care, and stays in a foster-home for socialization and adjustment before being placed for adoption. At St. Sophia&rsquo;s, we work hard to take care of cats with many different ages, genders, and medical and behavioral issues, and give each cat the benefit of the doubt, knowing that many have never known love or had a home. Each cat is different in many ways, and St. Sophia&rsquo;s prides itself on being able to determine what&rsquo;s best for each cat on a one-on-one basis.</p>

<p><strong>Our People</strong><br />
The Board Members of St. Sophia&rsquo;s Forgotten Felines have over 15 years combined of service in feline welfare . They come from various backgrounds including marketing, publishing, business, web-design, librarianship, entrepreneurship and more.</p>
