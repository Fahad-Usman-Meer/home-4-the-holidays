<p>PAWS is a small group of volunteers who work closely with the Fayette City Pound.</p>

<p>We evaluate dogs that are not claimed and foster/vet those we feel we can place.&nbsp; We have very effective spay/neuter/feral cat programs and work primariy with the Sedalia Spay/Neuter Clinic.</p>

<p>We rely on community funds and are grateful to those who contribute.&nbsp; We are in great need of more foster homes.</p>
