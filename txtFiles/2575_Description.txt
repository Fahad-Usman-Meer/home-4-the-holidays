Our goal is to help all homeless cats and dogs in our community.&nbsp; We work to care for homeless and stray cats and kittens as well as all homeless dogs that may come into the local dog pound. PAL devotes time to train pets that may have behavioral problems to make them great family pets. PAL is there for their community and the community responds.
