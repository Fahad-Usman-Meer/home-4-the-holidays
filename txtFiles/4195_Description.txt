Piggie Lovers Inc. is a home-based rescue in Latrobe, PA. We started out as just a Guinea Pig Rescue, but when we took a trip up to an Ohio High Kill Pound to adopt one of our personal dogs, we felt the need to help. <br />
<br />
Since April we have adopted out 45+ dogs of all different breeds, sizes and personalities! We don't go by breed, we pull the dogs that have been at the pound for awhile or the ones that really need us. Bring them home, get them used to the home environment, housetrain them, check for any aggressive behaviors and then find them their forever homes!<br />
<br />
We hope to meet our goal of 40 dogs, and 10 puppies! So that they too can have a Home not just for the Holidays, but FOREVER!<br />
