<h3>It starts with a wish.</h3>
<p>A wish for a better future for homeless pets.</p>
<p>Through the compassion of our volunteers, we inspire change, one community at a time.</p>
<p>We  help rescues &amp; shelters reach out to generate support, we  coordinate trap-neuter-release programs to prevent unwanted litters, and  we rescue &amp; rehome kittens, cats, dogs &amp; puppies, with a focus  on special needs pets.</p>
<p>Join our efforts to make this wish come true.</p>
