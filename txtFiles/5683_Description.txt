<p><font color="#666666" size="4" face="Times New Roman">Our philosophy is giving life back to animals that would face certain death through painful neglect, disease and illness. It is also about educating the public about the responsibilities involved in raising and caring for an animal.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#666666" size="4" face="Times New Roman">We care for small and large special needs animals.&nbsp; The special needs animals we take into our care are able to be rehomed after they have had extensive &amp; often expensive veterinary care.</font></p>
