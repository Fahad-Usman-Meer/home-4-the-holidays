Rottweiler Hearts Rescue is a new 501c3 breed specific rescue located in the RTP area of North Carolina. 

Our goal is to pull and rehabilitate rottweilers from rural kill shelters and place them into loving forever homes. 

We are an all foster rescue, which means we count on our volunteers and board members to open their homes and their hearts to rottweilers in need. If you are interested in learning more about us, volunteering, fostering, or adopting please check us out at www.rottweilerheartsrescue.org
