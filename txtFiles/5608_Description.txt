Loving Arms Animal Rescue & Adoption is a no-kill non-profit group of volunteers operating as a registered 501(c)(3) organization. Each year hundreds of abandoned, stray, or feral dogs and cats come into Loving Arms. Our goal is to place each and every one of them in a loving home. With the tax-deductible donations we receive, we are able to provide tender loving care, fostering, behavioral and physical rehabilitation, and whenever necessary, medical attention and care. They are then ready for adoption into the loving homes of those in our community. Our motto is: "From Loving Arms to loving homes!" â™¥ 

We focus on placing dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens as pets into loving homes. The donation fee for the adoption of each pet generally includes spay/neuter, deworming & de-fleaing, 1st round of vaccinations, and rabies shot. Microchip can be included by request.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
