<p><font face="Arial">Must Love Dogs Rescue began in 2007 with a dream to help homeless dogs in Oklahoma. We love dogs of any breed, size, age or attitude! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Our main focus is to work with city animal control shelters and other rescue groups to find loving homes for the many dogs that are either in cramped facilities or are on death row.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">MLD Rescue doesn't just help homeless dogs. We also provide the opportunity for boys and girls to learn about dog rescue. These kids help us take care of the dogs and help find the best homes for them at our adoption events. These amazing boys and girls give up their free time to help save dogs. They are more obedient about their chores and homework so they can enjoy this privilege. We're so moved and grateful for their dedication and sacrifice!</font></p>
