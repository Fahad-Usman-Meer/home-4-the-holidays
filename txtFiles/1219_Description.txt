<p>We are a NO KILL Sanctuary that only takes in dogs with special medical needs from Humane Societies, SPCA's and Pounds, that otherwise would not have a chance at adoption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We treat each medical condition,&nbsp; (we specialize in epilepsy but deal with almost every special medical need) and get these great dogs into the best health possible and find the most wonderful of homes for them who will love and care for them because they are extra special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they do not find a home, they live out the remainder of their lives, at the Sanctuary as family members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No animal is ever caged, and has full rights to every room here!&nbsp; They are fully socialised with other dogs, cats and children over 10.&nbsp; The only thing we cannot help out with is dogs with aggression issues.&nbsp; each animal here deserves peace and safety, which is why we cannot take in dogs who are aggressive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cats, we take in are sometimes special medical needs, or strayed, or abused/neglected.&nbsp; Again they are given the very best of care, and live as family members until the Purr-fect home is found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note all dogs and cats from our Sanctuary are spayed and neutered, UTD on vaccines, treated for fles, parasites, dogs heartworm, cats tested for FIV/FELV (when possible)health checked&nbsp;and loved and cherished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think you can find a spot in your home and heart for one of our special balls of love?</p>
