<p style="text-align: left;">At Purr Paws Rescue, our mission is to help place homeless cats &amp; kittens in new homes while providing education to the community on spaying &amp; neutering their pets.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purr Paws Rescue does not have a stand alone shelter.&nbsp; All of our cats and kittens live with their foster families during the times that they are not at adoptions.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">What does Purr Paws do?&nbsp; Before we place any cat or kitten in a new home, we: </p>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Spay or Neuter </li>
    <li>Vaccinate for FVRCCP (Kitten Shots) </li>
    <li>Vaccinate for Rabies (if &gt;3 months old) </li>
    <li>Test for FIV/FeLV </li>
    <li>Treat for worms / fleas / ear mites.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Any other treatment required to bring the cat or kitten to good health</li>
</ul>
Purr Paws is a no-kill organization.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Cats or kittens are not euthanized just because of space limitations.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Our foster homes work within their limits of how many fosters they can care for.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Some of our foster homes have sanctuary foster cats that are otherwise unadoptables due to health issues, temperment issues, etc.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
And sometimes things can fall into place, where the right person and the right cat are at the right place together!&nbsp; (Yes, it happens!)<br />
<br />
These sanctuary foster cats stay with us until they are adopted or until they pass away.&nbsp; While they are here with us, they receive the same care as all of our other foster and personal pets.<br />
