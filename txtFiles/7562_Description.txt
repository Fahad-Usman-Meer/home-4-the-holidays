<p>ICAN was started in 2007 and is an all-volunteer run, no-cage, no-kill animal shelter in beautiful British Columbia, Invermere, BC.&nbsp; We mainly house cats and kittens as that is what the need is here, but will take dogs and small animals as well if foster homes permit.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a registered charity and are currently&nbsp;in the beginning stages of a capital campaign to build a new adoption centre.&nbsp; We have been working out of a 60 year old house for the past 4 years and are rapidly outgrowing this location,&nbsp;not to mention that this dwelling is not set up to be an animal rescue shelter!&nbsp; Despite this, we have assisted more than 950&nbsp;companion animals in the past 7 years!</p>

<p>Please visit our website at www.icanbc.com or like us on Facebook to learn more about ICAN and to see our amazing animals for adoption!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tax receipts are promptly issued for donations of $20 or more.&nbsp;Our registered charity number is 83643 8219 RR0001.</p>
