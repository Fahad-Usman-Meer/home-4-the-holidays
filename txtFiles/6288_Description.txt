We are a 501(c)(3) NonProfit Organization located in McDermott, Ohio. We rescue abused, neglected, unmanagable, and unwanted horses or dogs of all types and breeds (including Mules). Then, we focus on how to best rehabilitate them so that the rescued&nbsp;animals can move on and be adopted into loving and nurturing homes. We work closely with area law enforcement/animal control and are often called by these agencies to pick up neglected animals that are abused, starving, or in untreated/poor health We do not discriminate on breed, age, condition or gender for all&nbsp;animals are special to us. We take them in love and treat them as our own and spare no expense to see they are well again. We are not a fancy ranch or a five star farm but what we lack in facilities we make up for in love and tenderness. <br />
