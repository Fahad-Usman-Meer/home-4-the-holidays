<p align="justify">Homeward Bound Golden Retriever Rescue &amp; Sanctuary, Inc. is a volunteer organization which rescues and heals displaced, abandoned, and homeless Golden Retrievers and Golden/Labrador mixes throughout Northern California, no matter their age or health. Homeward Bound secures safe, loving, homes through a comprehensive adoption program and also provides sanctuary for Goldens who cannot be adopted. Homeward Bound provides education on proper animal care and on the benefits of, and need for, rescue and sanctuary. Homeward Bound will continue to serve as a model rescue organization, which addresses animal welfare needs throughout California and neighboring states. Due to HBGRR&rsquo;s leadership in rescue, sanctuary, and education, all Golden Retrievers and other dogs will be well cared for, living in safe, nurturing, and loving homes. </p>
