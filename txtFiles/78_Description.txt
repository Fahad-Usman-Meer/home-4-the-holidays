We provide information, education, and exchange of ideas for ferret owners, owners to be, veterinarians, and pet store personnel in all aspects relating to the domestic companion ferret. We are home to many wonderful adoptable ferrets, young and old. Some who require special care or medication, have become permanent residents. We also rescue ferrets in situations where they are displaced from their homes and re-home them when possible.</font></p>
