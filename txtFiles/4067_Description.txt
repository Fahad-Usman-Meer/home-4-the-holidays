The Humane Society's Mountain Shelter, Inc is a &quot;tiny but mighty&quot; animal safe haven for society pets.&nbsp; We network with many other shelters and rescues in an effort to give each and every animal the very best opportunity for exposure with the ultimate result being permanent placement into a loving home.&nbsp; We provide care for dogs and cats and the occasional rabbit.&nbsp; Our staff and volunteers are dedicated to providing the animals at the center the very best of care, love, medical, and exercise during their usually short stay with us.&nbsp; We are thankful to boast a 33.8 day Average Length of Stay with a 99% placement record.&nbsp; We will not stop until every last animal has what he/ she deserves- a home of their own!
