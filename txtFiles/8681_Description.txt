We strive to educate the public about<span class="text_exposed_show">  the plight of homeless animals and encourage responsible pet ownership  by offering advice and literature on proper pet care, spaying and  neutering, and animal welfare. We secure permanent, quality homes for  every animal in our care. Only responsible pet owners are encouraged to  consider adopting a shelter animal. We also expose all adoptable animals  to as many prospective pet owners as possible through community events.</span></div>
