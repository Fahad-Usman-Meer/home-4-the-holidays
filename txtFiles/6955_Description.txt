<h2>ASDR Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Our mission is to provide foster care for small dogs in                      need while working to place them with permanent adoptive                      families.&nbsp; We will find families who have the personal                      commitment and compassion to give these dogs a safe, loving                      home for the rest of their lives. We promote the humane                      treatment and well being of these animals, and will educate the                      public whenever possible on the importance of spaying and                      neutering.</p>
