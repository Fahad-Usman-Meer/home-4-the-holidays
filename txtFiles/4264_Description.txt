<p>Tabby's Place is a cage-free sanctuary that provides refuge to cats in hopeless situations. Our residents come primarily from public shelters where they had once been scheduled for euthanasia.</p>
<p>Tabby&rsquo;s Place does not turn cats away due to age, medical need, or &ldquo;lack of adoptability.&rdquo; It is, therefore, a safe haven for several older, chronically ill, or handicapped cats. These cats have special needs such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or blindness. At Tabby&rsquo;s Place, these cats are able to live full and happy lives with the medical care, love, and affection they deserve. </p>
