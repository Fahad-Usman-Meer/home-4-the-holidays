<p> The Pulaski County Humane Society (PCHS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that is registered with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in accordance with the Virginia Solicitation of Contributions Law. We have been providing assistance to animals in need since 1979. </p>
<br>
<p> For more than five years we worked with the county to plan, design, and locate a new, modern shelter to replace the old, dilapidated shelter. Finally, after many donations and a lot of work, the new Pulaski County Animal Shelter and Humane Education Center opened its doors on April 9th, 2005. </p>
<br>
<p>The new shelter is an innovative and attractive facility that centralizes PCHS' efforts to help animals and educate pet owners. Our headquarters is located in the shelter, allowing us to manage the education room and its programs. In the future, the facility will also house the only sterilization clinic located in a county shelter in Southwest Virginia other than the Roanoke regional facility. When it opens, PCHS will manage and fund this clinic.</p>
<br>
<p> The Humane Society works closely with Pulaski County Animal Control to provide the best temporary home possible for rescued pets. Both Pulaski County Animal Control and the Pulaski County Humane Society share the new Pulaski County Animal Shelter and Humane Education Center. </p>
