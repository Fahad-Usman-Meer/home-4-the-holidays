<p>The County Animal Control Department has primary responsibility for enforcement of State and County Animal Control laws. It has custodial charge of lost or strayed animals in the County and is responsible for euthanization of unwanted animals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Saginaw County Animal Shelter sponsors an Animal Adoption Program to match unwanted animals to appropriate homes and responsible pet owners. Persons wishing to adopt an animal can visit the Animal Shelter kennels and choose from a wide variety of dogs and cats. Adopting an animal from the Saginaw County Animal Shelter is a rewarding experience! Some animals may be ready to go home with you the day of adoption and others may need to stay a few days to allow us time to get them spayed or neutered. Our skilled counselors are here to help guide you through the adoption process.</p>
