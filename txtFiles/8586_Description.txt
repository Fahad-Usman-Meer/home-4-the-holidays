<p>The  vision for ACT has   been brewing in the minds of the Animal Compassion  Team founders for many   years. The paths we have walked have prepared  us and tested our determination   through hard work, buckets of tears,  mountains of fecal matter (a favorite   topic of discussion amongst  animal rescuers), and more then our fair share of   discouragement and  heartbreak. Having said that, why would we choose to dive   in deeper?  For the love of the animals we serve. It is just that simple.   Dogs,  cats, and other wonderful animals are dying in huge numbers daily. We    hope to help change that. In August of 2009 we became a 501(c)3  non-profit   corporation with the state of California and the Federal  Government. It was,   and continues to be, a huge leap of faith for all  of us who already feel   overwhelmed by the work we are doing but we  believe this is the time....this   is what we have all been preparing  for. One life saved makes all the effort   and emotional investment  worthwhile. This is going to be an exciting journey   and we hope to  post MANY happy endings. New animals arrive daily......stay   tuned  .....we have only just begun!</p>
