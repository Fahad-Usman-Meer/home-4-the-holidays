<p><strong>We are a very small group of foster homes, specializing in all-breed dog rescue, pet education. and pit bull education.</strong>&nbsp;We do not have a shelter. Our volunteers are dedicated to providing a loving home environment for each foster dog. We strongly believe in educating the public on responsible pet care and restoring the image of the pit bull breeds through responsible pit bull ownership and education. We accomplish this through distributing printed educational material and providing online links to helpful pet care and behavior advice. </p>
