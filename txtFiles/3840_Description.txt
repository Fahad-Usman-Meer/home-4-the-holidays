Stray Rescue's sole purpose is to rescue stray animals in need of medical attention, restore them to health, and place them in loving adoptive homes.

Virtually all of the pets we save have been abused and neglected. They've been dumped on highways, or remote country roads. Abandoned in public parks, empty houses and dark alleys. We've even saved dogs left chained behind buildings after their owners had moved away.  Some are even feral--or wild--never touched by humans.  We rehab and they become wonderful companion animals.

Rescued animals often make the best pets. Pets from Stray Rescue seem to understand that they have a second lease on life. In return for affection and attention, these remarkable animals reward their new guardians with a love and loyalty unmatched anywhere.
