<p>Welcome to CMHS! &nbsp;The Central Missouri Humane Society exists to prevent and alleviate suffering and uncontrolled reproduction of companion animals with emphasis on public education, adoption&nbsp;and providing basic veterinary services for under-served pet owners. &nbsp;Our primary goal is to find caring, loving homes for every adoptable animal; we place more animals than any other humane organization in central&nbsp;Missouri. &nbsp;We are so proud to have maintained an over 90% live-release rate for all animals coming into our shelter! &nbsp;We are not affiliated with any national humane organizations and generate our funding primarily through private donations.</p>
