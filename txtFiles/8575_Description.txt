The key to finding great pets is to finding great people who work with them. They can be found among the foster families and volunteers of Catnip and Tails Rescue.

Catnip and Tails Rescue, Inc. was formed in May 2010, through a small group of rescuers/volunteers in the Omaha, NE / Council Bluffs, IA area that do this in our spare time because of our love and dedication in helping animals. We do not have a shelter, so many of our pets are placed in foster homes/temp adopt homes. We rescue homeless/abused/neglected/abandoned animals from high stressed situations. as well as those animals that are in danger of being euthanized at a shelter.

We never discriminate on the basis of health, age or breed. By involving and educating the community, Catnip and Tails Rescue works to raise the public's awareness of the plight of homeless animals as well as realizing the benefits of adopting an animal in need. Our animals are examined, vaccinated, spayed or neutered and receive any and all medical treatment before they are placed in carefully screened homes.

Catnip and Tails Rescue is a registered non-profit (501c3) animal rescue organization. We are state licensed in both Iowa and Nebraska with the Department of Agriculture. We rescue homeless/abused/neglected/abandoned animals from high stressed situations. as well as those animals that are in danger of being euthanized at a shelter.
