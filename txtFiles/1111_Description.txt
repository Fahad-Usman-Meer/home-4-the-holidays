<p><strong>Happy Tails is a small group of volunteers dedicated to the rescue and placement of abused, neglected and unwanted animals. We are a Michigan &quot;no-kill,&quot; 501(C)(3)non-profit organization operating in Macomb and parts of Wayne, and Oakland counties. &nbsp;We do not have a shelter facility. &nbsp;All of our pets are in foster homes where they receive all of the same love, training and care that the Foster&#39;s own pets receive.&nbsp;</strong></p>
