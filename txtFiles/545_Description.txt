<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Our first step toward this goal was to open our low cost spay neuter clinic in July 2000.&nbsp;High volume spay neuter is essential to reducing the numbers of animals entering shelters and pounds each year.&nbsp;Every spay neuter will prevent the births of four or more animals over the next few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Our second step was to form alliances with many animal rescue groups and individuals.&nbsp;This has increased our adoptions and transfers of animals and reduced killing at the local Animal Control pound.&nbsp;The foster homes have increased our capacity greatly and provided one on one care for animals in need. </span></div>

<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Our most recent step has been to open our no kill Adoption Center in April 2009.&nbsp;The Adoption Center is a wonderful place designed to be safe and pleasant for the animals and for the people who come to the Adoption Center to adopt, volunteer and work.&nbsp;Our high visiblility location on a major highway and large storefront windows demonstrate our idea to market our adoptable pets as just as valuable as any pet store puppy or kitten.</span></div>
