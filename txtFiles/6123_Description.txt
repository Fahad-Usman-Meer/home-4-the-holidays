<font size="5"><font size="4">We are a very small rescue group. We do not have a physical shelter. Our animals stay in boarding facilities. Due to very limited funds, we can only afford to house one dog at a time. We are working with </font><a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=14060728"><font size="4">Pause for Paws</font></a><font size="4"> (a wonderful 501 C 3 rescue group) to get an adorable little Ibizan Hound/ Whippet Mix named Rodney adopted.<br />
His medical and boarding bills are over $6,000.00 dollars so donations are always appreciated. (We are not a 501 C 3 at the moment) <br />
If you can help sponsor Rodney's medical bills, please click the &quot;donate&quot; button below.<br />
Or you can send donations directly to Rodney's vet at <br />

<font size="4">Please note that Rodney's Rescue Connections is not a 501 C 3 organization. Any donations made through this page are not tax deductible. Although we are not 501 C 3, we do not make any profit. Any donations sent to our little organization or directly to Rodney's vet will be used only for Rodney or other homeless, sick, or injured fuzzy friends. We presently subsist only on the Director's personal income.<br />
If you would like to donate to a 501 C 3, please check out Pause for Paws - they could also use help and your contributions will be tax deductible. </font><a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/TX979.html"><font size="4">Pause for Paws Home Page </font></a><br />

They help to get dogs off of chains/tethers.<br />

Because of very limited funds, we are unable to take in any fuzzy, feathery, or scaly friends at the moment. It's a sad fact that many animals in San Antonio are stray, homeless or lost and most shelters/rescue groups are overflowing. Please see below for resources<br />
