Annie's Rescue is a last chance rescue for pets that would normally not be accepted into traditional rescues do to illness, injury, age, breed, behavioral issues and/or appearance.  We strive to care for these pets as long term fosters for as long as it takes to rehabilitate them and place them in the perfect home for life.
