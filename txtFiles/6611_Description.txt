			<strong>MISSION STATEMENT:<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			We are a small group dedicated to the rescue and adoption of homeless cats.We are&nbsp;not a shelter. All of the cats we rescue are from high kill shelters,or TNR Projects many times we are their last hope for finding a new forever home. WE DO NOT TAKE IN OWNED/FOUND PETS. WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU FIND A HOME FOR YOUR PET All of the pets we rescue and adopt are non-feral, most have been home raised in a family setting with other pets and people. All of our pets are tested for FELV/FIV, given age related vaccines, wormed, and have been given protection against fleas. Those that are old enough have been spayed/neutered. Those that are not yet altered must be at the time of adoption,and are spayed/neutered by a local clinic and is included in any adoption fees. Our group also helps to educate the public about the benefit of owning and being owned by a rescued cat, the importance of spaying and neutering, and other aspects on how to be a responsible owner by providing the proper care and training. We ultimately hope to reduce the number of cats that require rescue, or are needlessly euthanized. </strong><br />
