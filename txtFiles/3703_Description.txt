<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Tahoma"><span style="font-family: arial;">               Established in 1982, the Animal Rescue and Adoption Society is a non-profit,          no-kill cat shelter located in Denver, Colorado. Society staff and volunteers          care for approximately 185-200 homeless, abandoned, abused, and neglected cats and kittens. ARAS receives          no government funding and is dependent upon donations from the community          and the proceeds from fundraising events. <br />
<br />
The shelter is located in an industrial area, less than five miles from          Downtown Denver. ARAS originally began in a garage, then relocated to      its present location where it has existed for about 22 years.<br />
<br />
ARAS has many loveable cats of all ages, shapes and sizes, all of which          need homes. If you are looking to adopt a cat from ARAS, please come in          and complete an application at the shelter, or download one by clicking          <strong style="font-weight: 400;">      <a style="color: rgb(4, 128, 128); text-decoration: underline;" href="http://arascolorado.tripod.com/application.pdf">HERE</a></strong> if you have Adobe          Acrobat Reader. We ask for the entire family who will be adopting to meet      the cat, and provide documentation of proof of address (lease agreement,          recent bill, valid driver's license), and a phone number for your veterinarian.          <br />
For applicants who rent, we require consent of your landlord.</span></font></p>
