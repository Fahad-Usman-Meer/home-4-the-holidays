<p align="center">The City of Coquitlam Animal shelter is a municply run no-kill for adoptable animals shelter. All the animals that are at the shelter have been stray and are now looking for their new forever homes. All animals that arrive at the shelter are held for 7 days to help owners find their lost pets. The staff at the shelter strives to reunite lost animals with their owners, and works to find new homes for the animals that are not claimed. </p>

<p align="center">The shelter has a very successful volunteer program and all are welcome. We hold 2 hour orientations once a month and then volunteers are required to participate in an &quot;in house&quot; orientation of the shelter.&nbsp; The Animal Shelter is always accepting new volunteers. All volunteers must attend our orientation session that is held monthly. Orientations are usually held on a Wednesday evening at 7pm at City Hall (3000 Guilford Way). Please contact the shelter for the next orientation date.&nbsp; </p>
