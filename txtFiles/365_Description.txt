<p>Now called FieldHaven Feline Center, FieldHaven Feline Rescue was established in 2003 to provide a safe haven for rescued cats and kittens while awaiting adoption. FieldHaven is located on a private horse ranch in rural Lincoln where the adult cats are sheltered. A network of foster homes provide housing for young kittens until they are adopted through the main shelter or satellite sites made available through adoption partnerships with PetSmart and Petco. FieldHaven has a &ldquo;Spay Neuter Assistance Program,&rdquo; (SNAP) to assist the community with free and low-cost spay/neuter. There are ongoing efforts to educate the public about proper pet care, the benefits of neutering and the Trap, Neuter, Release (TNR) option to control feral cat colonies, plus it is a great place to volunteer.</p>
