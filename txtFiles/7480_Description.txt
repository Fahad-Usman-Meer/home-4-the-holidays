<p>Dedicated to finding exceptional homes for exceptional cats</p>

<p>Specializing in Manx, but we&#39;ll accept Japanese or American Bobtails and Pixie-bobs</p>

<p>In 1995 my neighbor&#39;s Manx cat had kittens.&nbsp; There was a tiny runt in the litter that wasn&#39;t expected to survive.&nbsp; I was there when the kittens were born, and I volunteered to provide a home for the runt if she made it.&nbsp; That was Misty, and the beginning of my love for the Manx breed.<br />
After several years of rescuing Manx and other tailless cats through all breed rescues, in 2006 I decided to start my own rescue and TCR was born.</p>
