Each of the dogs who come to us is cared for in our home, with love, vetting, and lots of care. Most of these Poms have been neglected and or abused. It is our objective to make them feel secure, safe, happy and protected.<br />
We are NOT a shelter - we are a rescue. We rescue from the most desperate situations. Most of our rescues are either 'special needs' or seniors, or puppy mill survivors or rescued from abuse situations. All Poms adopted from this organization will be vaccinated, microchipped, heart worm tested, on heart worm and flea prevention, spayed or neutered. (certain exceptions may apply)<o:p></o:p></font></span></p>
