<p>All Dogs' Heaven (ADH) is an all volunteer rescue group dedicated to rescuing <br />
homeless, abandoned, neglected, abused and puppy mill dogs. In addition, as <br />
space permits, we even take in dogs that cannot be cared for by their current <br />
owner. Our mission is to rescue, medically treat, provide housing and place dogs <br />
in loving, permanent homes. </p>
<p>All Dogs' Heaven is a non-profit 501c3 organization. We have no paid staff <br />
and operate&nbsp; through the volunteers that donate time and talent to save the <br />
lives of the many wonderful dogs that we have in our care.</p>
