Tails of Hope Animal Rescue is dedicated to finding forever homes for  dogs and puppies that were abandoned at County Shelters.&nbsp; Our outreach  is limited due to our available foster space, but we do everything that  we can to help pull puppies and dogs from at capacity kill shelters.&nbsp; We  generally try to focus on the tristate area, pulling from rural  shelters in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, but sometimes we get pulled into  cases from other parts of the country.
<p>Once a dog or puppy comes into our program, we do age appropriate  vetting and work hard to match them with approved homes.&nbsp; We also are  dedicated to making sure that each dog and puppy that comes through our  program is altered so that they don't contribute in the future to the  gross pet overpopulation problem that plagues the tristate area.&nbsp; Older  puppies and adults are altered before being adopted out, and puppies are  required via our contract and a spay/neuter deposit to be altered when  they are deemed old enough by a veterinarian.</p>
