<font size="2"><font face="Verdana"><font color="#008080">Franklin County Humane Society&nbsp;</font>promotes  the health, welfare and humane treatment of animals in Northwestern  Vermont by providing temporary shelter for them with the ultimate goal  of finding them good, permanent homes within the community.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> FCHS was originally established in 1964 by  several area residents who wanted to help the growing numbers of abused  animals in their community. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Franklin County Humane Society has grown  from a totally volunteer effort by a small group of concerned residents  to an incorporated 501 &copy;3 non-profit organization that is privately  owned and receives no government funding.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In 1996 the shelter made  its way to its current location at 30 Sunset Meadow in Saint Albans  City. The 3500 square foot building was intended to comfortably house  approximately 23 dogs and 30 cats; numbers which more often than not are  exceeded.&nbsp; </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">The future of FCHS depends  totally on caring, generous individuals to ensure its ability to shelter  these animals until they can find their rightly deserved loving  permanent homes.</font>
