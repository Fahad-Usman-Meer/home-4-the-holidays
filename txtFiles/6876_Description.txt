<p>We  are dedicated to educate, train, and assist people who are seeking help  with stray and feral cats. Whether it be one cat or large colonies, we  provide one-on-one advice on methods of TNR, and supply printed  instructions on all steps of managing a colony. From start to finish, we  are here for people that want to learn TNR. </p>
<p>Getting the message out about  low-cost spay/neuter clinics is one of our main goals because many  people are unaware of these programs. Expenses are a main concern for  caretakers and, very often, is the only factor preventing them from  managing the growth of colonies.</p>
<p>We are happy to communicate with  anyone who feels overwhelmed as to what they can do to help the cats  that they feed. Sometimes just emotional support can give people enough  confidence to get involved with TNR and to pass on their knowledge to  other caretakers.</p>
<p>Foster homes are an important part  of TNR because friendly cats and kittens are not returned to colonies.  We offer postings on our website, assistance with Adoption Flyers, and  offer networking assistance between shelters, veterinarians, and other  rescue groups.</p>
