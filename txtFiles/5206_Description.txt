<p>The Platte Valley Humane Society was organized in the 19780&#39;s and worked helping to find homes for animals in the Columbus City Shelter.&nbsp; In 2008 our shelter, the Erna R. Badsteiber Paws and Claws Adoption Center was opened and all city animals are now cared for by us.&nbsp; We are extremely proud of our facility as well as our adoption and reclaim percentages.&nbsp; After being in business for over seven years, we are sure that the lost and stray animals in our community are receiving the best of care as we continue to find new homes for the animals that can not speak for themselves.</p>
