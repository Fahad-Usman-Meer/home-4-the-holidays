<p>Welcome to Leashes of Love, a dog rescue located in Dallas-Fort Worth.&nbsp; We specialize in socializing, vetting and finding ideal homes for the dogs in our care.&nbsp; Our goal is to provide families with a dog that is a good fit for their needs and lifestyle so that the dog will have a permanent home with a loving family. </p>

<p>We are a volunteer orgnization that works with area shelters to give dogs a second chance.&nbsp; Our dogs are placed in foster homes with wonderful families who work with the dog on needed social skills and provide love, care and training.&nbsp; All of our dogs are examined by a veterinarian.&nbsp; They receive age-appropriate vaccinations and are spayed/neutered prior to adoption.&nbsp; We begin crate training, house training, basic obedience and socialization with other dogs while they are with us.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Our adoption fees range from $100 to $175 depending upon the circumstances involving each individual dog.&nbsp; That fee is used toward the veterinary care, food and supplies for the dogs.&nbsp; Dogs are not placed on a first-come, first-served basis, but rather matched based on the needs of the dog and the desires/lifestyle of the adopter.&nbsp; Interested families must complete an adoption application, allow their information to be verified, and meet with representatives of the rescue prior to adopting a dog from our program.&nbsp; Due to the nature of this process, all adopters must live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p>

<p>We are a young, small rescue with the goal of saving the lives of dogs, one at a time.&nbsp; In our first six months of operation we have found homes for over 25 dogs.&nbsp; Thanks to the support and assistance of volunteers, we hope to double that effort in the next six months!</p>
