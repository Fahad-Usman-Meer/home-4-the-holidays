<p><strong>Furrever Friends Rescue and Volunteers, Inc. (FFRV) is an all-volunteer-run 501(c)(3) nonprofit that specializes in saving the lives of cats and finding them stable, loving, FURREVER homes in the Delaware Valley area (NJ/PA).&nbsp; </strong></p>
</p>

<p><strong>We are a &quot;No-Kill&quot; Organization.&nbsp; We do not euthanize any of the animals in our care simply to make room for new ones.&nbsp; Although our operation is small, each and every homeless pet in our program receives the absolute best care possible until a &quot;Furrever Home&quot; can be found.&nbsp; Through our adoption center and foster homes, we provide a safe environment for the cats in our care until they are adopted.</strong></p>
