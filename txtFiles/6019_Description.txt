<font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Social Tees Animal Rescue</strong></font> <font face="Comic Sans MS">(S.T.A.R.) is a non-profit, strictly no-kill 501c3 organization that takes abandoned animals from the kill shelters and provides them with a safe haven and veterinary care until they are placed in a proper home.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
*&nbsp; We rescue, rehabilitate and place over 3000 dogs, cats, birds and reptiles per year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
*&nbsp; All dogs and cats for adoption are spayed/neutered, tested, vaccinated, de-wormed, de-flead, de-mited, microchipped and more.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
*&nbsp; We also run a special program for underdogs and undercats.&nbsp; We house over 20 feral cats and take on as many amputees, blind, and injured animals as possible before they are euthanized<br />
