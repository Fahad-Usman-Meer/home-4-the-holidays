<font size="4">All of our dogs and puppies are in foster homes.&nbsp; We have over 100 enrolled in our program.&nbsp; We have accepted over 500 so far this year, adopting out about 375 of those.&nbsp; We adopt at a Petco in Humble Texas and through our website.&nbsp; We vet check all of our dogs, give them vaccinations, and spay/neuter them before adoption.&nbsp; We have been doing this for about eight years with the help of wonderful volunteers.</font>
