<p>We have teamed up with&nbsp;Utah's only 501(c)3, non-profit, no-kill exotic critter sanctuary. We're the only sanctuary in the state that has on staff experts that have over 37 years specializing in the care and transport of birds, ferrets, reptiles and other exotic critters. We deal mainly with the stress and depression that is life threading to exotic pets when moved from one home to another. We also are the only sanctuary in the state that will never split up bond pairs or cage-mates that are surrendered into the sanctuary together. Also any items that are turned in with any animal will stay with that pet and go with them to their new home. We will not sell any animals items separately from that pet like other shelters do. We are celebrating our 38 anniversary this year. How the years fly when you're having so much fun loving on all the critters that have passed through our doors. We opened our doors as a reptile sanctuary on 1-01-70 then added the birds and later the ferrets and it just kept building from there. Now if any critter no matter what its species is in need of help we'll do whatever we can for it. If you find yourself in need to relocate or surrender a critter, be it a pet or one you found call us and let see if we can help. We do offer free pick up of critters and we don't charge a surrendering fee. All critters are housed in a home environment at the sanctuary. We find this warm, loving home style environment make the critters in our care less stressful. It gives us the ability to get to know the critter's true personality so we can match critters perfectly to its forever home. We are a 24-7 emergency rescue and care clinic for sick, injured, abused, healthy, abandon, homeless, lost and found critters. Any temperament or in any condition call us we're willing to help.</p>
