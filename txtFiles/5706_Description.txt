<p>Paws 4 You Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)3 non-profit, volunteer, donor-subsidized animal rescue organization based in Miami, Florida. &nbsp;Our top priority is to save dogs from euthanasia at Miami-Dade Animal Services, where more than 27,000 unwanted pets end up each year.</p>

<p>Rescued animals vary from being sick, injured, homeless and surrendered to simply lost. &nbsp;We give these animals a safe environment at our shelter, professional medical care, hope and lots of love. &nbsp;Our animals are sterilized, vaccinated and ID micro-chipped to prevent future loss. &nbsp;Some require&nbsp;major surgery from a specialist to repair broken limbs while others may need additional rehabilitation time and specific medical care - ranging from respiratory illnesses and skin infections to cherry eyes and heartworm treatments.</p>

<p>Once Paws 4 You Rescue commits to helping an animal, we seek the best quality treatment available - taking no shortcuts. &nbsp;In order to increase our animals&#39; visibility, we spend time taking our new friends to different events across South Florida in search of forever homes. &nbsp;Our team is compassionate and passionate in reaching these goals. &nbsp;We are a group of professional people with various backgrounds, who together commit to saving as many animals as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally, we believe in the value of education pertaining to the importance of spaying and neutering. &nbsp;Pet overpopulation is a serious problem in our county and by sterilizing your pet, you help relieve the strain on Miami-Dade Animal Services and our community.</p>
