<h3>Who We Are</h3>

<p>Incorporated in 1980, Action for Animals, Inc. is an all volunteer, non-profit organization dedicated to helping the animals of Delaware County, Indiana. We take in stray cats and dogs (although, at this time, we have no dog foster homes so we are unable to take in dogs), provide medical care, spay/neuter surgery, and placement into permanent homes. We implement a Catch, Alter, Release program to help control the unwanted feral cat overpopulation in Delaware County. Also, we have our Spay Day program, providing $20 off a spay or neuter surgery to anyone in our county or in other areas that need <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/IN380.html#">financial assistance</a> with the cost of altering their pets. We promote responsible pet ownership through our education efforts.&nbsp; We also have a community pet food pantry for families who live in Delaware County and need assistance with food for their pets.</p>

<h3>Adopting a friend</h3>

<p>We place approximately 15 cats/kittens per month through our foster program. Most of our placements are done through our local PetSmart store. We have just recently begun our relationship with <a href="http://www.petfinder.com">www.petfinder.com</a> and <a href="http://www.adoptapet.com">www.adoptapet.com</a> and we hope that&nbsp;this will provide us with the <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/IN380.html#">opportunity</a> to reach even more potential homes for the great pets in our program! There is an <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/IN380.html#">application</a> process that we follow. If you have pets already, we do require verification that your current pets are up to date on vaccinations, especially for Rabies (per state law). If you rent, we require verification from your landlord/apartment manager that you are permitted to have indoor pets. We also ask for and contact two personal references. This process is to help protect all involved, especially the animal. We want to make sure that the pets we place are going to the best home for them to live the rest of their lives. We ask for a minimum adoption donation of $60 to help defray the medical/care costs that we incur on each pet. Our average expenses per pet is $125 and that is if he/she comes to us healthy and uninjured! Many of our wonderful friends are hurt or sick when they are found and require a lot of medical care and time to be ready for adoption!</p>

<h3>Come Visit Us!</h3>

<p>Unlike many other rescues, we do not have a specific shelter building. The volunteers who can foster pets, do so from their own homes. If one of the cats you are interested in is at PetSmart, you can go visit them during the store&#39;s normal hours. If the cat is still at the foster home, arrangements can be made for you to meet your potential new pet!</p>
