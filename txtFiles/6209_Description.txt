We are a non-profit NO KILL shelter that has been in Amarillo for over twenty years.&nbsp; With over 18,000 animals put down last year in Amarillo alone, our mission is to see that&nbsp;all of our&nbsp;animals find the purrfect homes, and until then, we'll love and spoil them rotten! We care for dogs and cats, young and old.
