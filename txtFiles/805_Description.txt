<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kalamazoo County Animal Services &amp; Enforcement is a County-Operated Shelter that handles everything from strays, owner surrenders, adoptions, euthanasia, citizen complaints, humane&nbsp;law enforcement and more.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Each year, like other shelters across the country, we take in more animals than we can find homes for.&nbsp; While many of the animals that we euthanize are too sick or aggressive to be adopted, there are many others that there is nothing wrong with other than a lack of homes willing to take the pet.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kalamazoo County Animal Services &amp; Enforcement is the only stray animal shelter in Kalamazoo County. Hundreds of lost, abandoned, unwanted and seized animals come to our shelter each year. While those animals are here, we feed and care for them until they are claimed by their owners, a new family, a rescue group, or until we can no longer keep the animal in our facility.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">All stray animals are given 7 days to be reclaimed by an owner. After 7 days the animal may be adopted, rescued or euthanized. Once the animal has left the property with a new family or a rescue, the original owner will not be able to reclaim it even with proof of ownership. Because of this, its important that owners actively search for their animals if they want it returned home. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Animal Services also takes found reports from people who are hanging on to stray dogs, and we also pick up DOA domestic animals that have been deceased less than 24 hours. Those animals are not listed on Pet Finder. Please call and inquire.</font></p>
