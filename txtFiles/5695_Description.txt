<span id="lblShelterDescription">&nbsp;
<p>We are an independent Greyhound rehoming group operating throughout Victoria. All of our Greyhounds are vet checked, desexed, vaccinated and heartworm tested prior to going into foster care. Once in foster care they are treated as part of the family, and begin their journey &quot;from Kennel to Couch&quot;. </p>
<p>Greyhounds are very easy pets to have around, they are loyal, gentle and very low maintenance.</p>
<p>Please visit our website&nbsp; </p>
