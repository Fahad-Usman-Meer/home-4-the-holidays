<p>The SPCA of Northern Nevada is celebrating 17 years of bringing people and pets together at Reno&rsquo;s pioneer &ldquo;no-kill&rdquo; animal shelter. We believe in second chances, forever homes, and lifetime commitments.</p>

<p>Our mission is to be an innovative regional leader in the responsible treatment of homeless dogs and cats, primarily through their rescue and placement in forever loving homes, and by promoting spaying and neutering to control pet overpopulation. We accomplish our mission with dedication to our core values and a lifetime commitment to our animals.</p>
