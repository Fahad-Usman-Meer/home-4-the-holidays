<font size="3">Lighthouse Boxer Rescue is a non profit organization that specializes in the rescue and rehoming of displaced boxer dogs.&nbsp; Lighthouse is a volunteer organization that does not have a facility, but houses foster dogs in our trained volunteer's homes.&nbsp; All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm tested, microhipped, crate trained and evaluated for temperment before being placed up for adoption.&nbsp; Our adoption process consists of interested parties completely on online adoption application, we then do a vet check, personal reference check, and come out and do a home visit before anyone is approved to adopt from us.</font>
