<h4 align="left">A Home&nbsp;Away, is a small privately owned and operated, rescue shelter and boarding kennel. As the owner and operator my credentials lie within my over 35 yrs of animal professions.&nbsp;We are just outside of the Greenfield City&nbsp;limits in the country, one fourth of a mile&nbsp;back off the road. All of our pets are adopted out spay or neutered and of course fully vaccinated. We do our best to insure the safest and best life for these animals and their adoptive parents matching pets with human lifestyles. We also believe that at least 95% of surrenders of pets are because of behavior problems, which in most cases with education, training and consistancy, patience and positive reinforcement you will have a happier, healther pet and pet partner&nbsp;&nbsp;relationship.&nbsp; &quot;A Home Away&quot; is a no kill shelter&nbsp;striving to educate, help pet owners and pets with questions they may need answers to in order to be or become a responsible pet owner. We also promote Spay and Neuter and work with low cost clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
