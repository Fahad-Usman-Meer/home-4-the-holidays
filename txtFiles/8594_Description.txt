<p>The Seagoville Animal Shelter is the first municipal animal shelter in Texas to achieve No Kill status. With a live release rate of 98% for the past two years, our goal is to find every healthy, adoptable pet a forever home. Our staff, volunteers and&nbsp; city management are committed to this goal. Our nonprofit volunteer organization, Seagoville Texas Animal Advocates and Rescue (<a href="http://www.staarescue.org">www.staarescue.org</a>) performs adoption events, fundraisers and provides funds for the veterinary care of the animials in our shelter. Please check our our Facebook page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/seagovilleanimalshelter">www.facebook.com/seagovilleanimalshelter</a>) to see our adoptable pets, adoption events and to make a donation.</p>
