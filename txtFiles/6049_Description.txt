<p>The Animal Rescue Network is a no-kill non-profit organization, staffed entirely by volunteers, dedicated to giving abandoned and/or abused cats a second chance at a happy life</p>

<p>We operate a shelter and network of foster homes for the rescue, housing, physical and emotional care, sterilization and adoption of cats under our care</p>

<p>We advise, inform, educate and sensitize the community in order to improve the lives of companion animals.</p>

<p>Did you know that the province of Quebec has the worst record of animal abandonment in all of North America ? Help us change this !<br />
<br />
There are many ways you can help us to help the cats and dogs of Montreal, including <strong>adopting</strong>, <strong>fostering</strong>, <strong>sponsoring, making a donation</strong>, and <strong>volunteering at the shelter</strong>.</p>

<p>Together, we can make a difference.&nbsp;</p>
