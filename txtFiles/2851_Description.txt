We participated in Iams Home 4 the Holidays for several years. It was difficult to anticipate adoptions as our organization takes in all breeds, ages, color of fur of cats and dogs.&nbsp; The rewards of this program was not apparent.&nbsp; So we&nbsp; have concentrated our efforts on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp; AHF applauds you&nbsp;for your efforts to help homeless animals.&nbsp; We'll reconsider if rewards are understood and proves to worth the effort - as we have limited resources.&nbsp; </font>
