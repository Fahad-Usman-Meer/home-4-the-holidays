<p>For the homeless cats and kittens taken in by SAFe&nbsp;Rescue, the new Adoption Center is the first stop on their journey to a new life. They may arrive frightened, traumatized, or in need of medical care. They may not know what it means to be loved and cared for by humans&mdash;but the Adoption Center is designed to show them that care from the moment they arrive. The exam room allows shelter staff and volunteers to assess their needs in a quiet area. The quarantine enclosures keep them safe from disease until they receive their vaccines. The safe, comfortable adoption enclosures help their purring personalities shine.</p>

<p>Then, it happens! Each kitty has its special day when someone visits the center and falls in love. They meet their perfect people in one of the adoption rooms, and then they go home forever.</p>
