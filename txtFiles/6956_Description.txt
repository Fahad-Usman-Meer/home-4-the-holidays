<p><strong>Project Purr BR exists to save as many cats and kittens as possible from East Baton Rouge Animal Control. Prior to our existence, 90% of all felines that entered that facility died there. Project Purr&nbsp;is changing that and&nbsp;is helping to lead&nbsp;Baton Rouge into a time in which no healthy or treatable cat or kitten is killed.</strong></p>
