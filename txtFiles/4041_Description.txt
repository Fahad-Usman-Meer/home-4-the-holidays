<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">We provide food, shelter, medical attention, and LOTS OF LOVE to our &quot;Furbabies&quot;, many of whom have lost faith and trust in humans.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">We have found that, with time and loving care, we can renew their trust in people and that all these dogs need is love, care, and &quot;A NEW BEGINNING&quot; at a happier life with someone that loves them unconditionally.&nbsp;Our adoption process matches the right dog with the right family.</div>
