<p>Friends for Life Animal Rescue is an all-volunteer, non-profit, no-kill companion animal rescue group working via a network of foster homes. We do not have a shelter or facility, instead raising animals in our homes in close contact with people and conducting adoptions form home and through adoption partners like Petco store.</p>
<p>All animals in our care are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, treated for fleas, mites, and worms, and microchipped prior to being available for adoption.&nbsp; In addition, cats are tested for feline leukemia and feline AIDS and dogs are often tested for heartworms and vaccinated for rabies in addition to routine dog diseases.</p>
