Independent Cat Society is a small no-kill shelter for homeless cats and kittens.&nbsp; Now in our 33rd year of helping magnificent cats, our mission is to find forever homes for all of our cats, promote animal welfare and education, and to develop spay and neuter programs for all animals, especially cats.
