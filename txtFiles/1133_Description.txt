<p>Angels of Assisi is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and care of all living creatures.</p>

<p>We provide reduced cost medical care to companion animals with special emphasis on spaying and neutering to prevent pet overpopulation. We provide shelter, care and sustenance to companion and domesticated farm animals in need, including an adoption center for homeless dogs and cats and a farm animal sanctuary.</p>

<p>With community support, accomplishments to date include:<br />
&bull;80,000 low cost spay and neuter surgeries<br />
&bull;7,500 low cost wellness visits<br />
&bull;4,000 feral cat sterilizations<br />
&bull;8,000 adoptions<br />
&bull;900 animals rescued from puppy mills, animal control seizures, and hoarding cases</p>

<p>Our mission is to two fold- to increase awareness that companion and farm animals are not objects for human use but are living, sentient creatures deserving respect and kindness. Angels of Assisi is also dedicated to providing much needed services to pet owners to make caring for their pets easier and lasting relationships are formed.</p>
