<font size="4"><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#cc99ff"><strong><font size="3">Four Paws and Tail Rescue was established by and 18 year old girl who has a passion and heart for animals. She has always loved animals and has had 6 dogs and 3 cats, but she didn't realize what horrible and inhumane things some animals go through. She at the age of 17 started fostering for Purring Pals and Delaware Puppy Rescue. She recieved a few crys for help from different people, she tooks these animals in, and then established her rescue, it was founded in Ocotber of 2006, it is currently not a 501(c)3 rescue but she hopes to be someday. Her wonderful mom, Marian,&nbsp; helps her take care of the cats, kittens and dogs that come in.&nbsp; Jamie pays for all of the vet expenses by herself, she goes to school full time at the local college and has 2 jobs. We hope one day to be noticed and well respected organization. </font><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></strong></font></font></font>
