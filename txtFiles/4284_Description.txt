<p>The Scratching Post has been in existence since June, 1990 and was the first shelter in the area to provide spay/neuter vouchers to the public,which were accepted by almost all veterinarians in this area.&nbsp; Since 1992, we have paid over $500,000 to area vets&nbsp;through our voucher program called CATSnip.&nbsp;&nbsp;The voucher program has been temporarily stopped while we pay for another first!&nbsp; In April we moved into our new &quot;Green Building&quot;&nbsp;shelter, the first shelter in this area to incorporate Green Building principles.&nbsp; Now we are not only helping cats and kittens lead healthier, better lives, but we are also helping the environment.&nbsp; We invite everyone who comes to Cincinnati to visit our beautiful new facility, meet our wonderful cats, and shop in our year-round-fundraising store, The Meow Mart, which has anything and everything for cats and cat lovers.&nbsp; It is located next to The Scratching Post.</p>
