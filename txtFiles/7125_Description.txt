<p><strong>The Tri-Lakes Humane Society&nbsp;is located in beautiful Saranac Lake, NY,&nbsp;in the heart of the&nbsp;Adirondack Mountains. Our mission is to provide shelter to all stray and unwanted companion and domestic animals. We work toward educating the public about proper animal care, including spaying and neutering, providing adequate outdoor housing,&nbsp;food &amp; water, veterinarian care,&nbsp;and the many different state and local laws and ordinances that a&nbsp;pet owner should be made aware&nbsp;of and abide by.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our Humane Society is an incorporated Non-Profit 501(c)3 organization, and is&nbsp;maintained as a No-Kill facility.&nbsp;We are proud to say that we have placed over 3000 animals into new homes, and reunited over 1000 animals with their owners, since 2001. Our day to day goal is to provide the best temporary&nbsp;home and&nbsp;compassionate&nbsp;care&nbsp;for our shelter animals until they&nbsp;are adopted into&nbsp;new forever homes.&nbsp;</strong></p>
