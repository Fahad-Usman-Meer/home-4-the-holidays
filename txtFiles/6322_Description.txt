Pet Haven has four primary purposes, as noted in our mission statement. We rescue and re-home cats and dogs, spay and neuter to reduce overpopulation, promotes companion animal welfare, and advocate on behalf of companion animals.
Pet Haven's adoption program helps homeless dogs and cats find new homes. We provide them with veterinary care including a spay or neuter. All of the animals in our adoption program stay in volunteer foster homes until they are adopted. The foster families care for the animal and learn about its needs and temperament. This helps us to find a suitable permanent home that is a good match for the cat or dog. Pet Haven is 'no kill'. This means we do not euthanize any of the animals taken into our adoption program unless they have an untreatable health or behavioral condition that prevents an acceptable quality of life or makes them a serious threat to the safety of people or other animals.
