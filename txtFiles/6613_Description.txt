We are a simple and small group who helps foster and rehome Pit bulls mainly, but we never turna away an animal&nbsp; in need! We also go out into the community to raise awareness of the breed! The area is rural and many people are fearful of the&nbsp; breed because they have no experience or education on the breed, which is were we come in.
