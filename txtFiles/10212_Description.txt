<p>Animal Lovers of South Bay have been rescuing&nbsp;cats (and the occasional small dog they couldn&#39;t resist)&nbsp;from Harbor Shelter in San Pedro, CA and Carson Shelter in Gardena, CA.</p>

<p>Every Saturday and Sunday for 8 years they&#39;ve held adoption events at the Centinela Feed in Rancho Palos Verdes. &nbsp;All of the cats they rescue are fostered by the two principals or volunteers, until they can find their forever homes.</p>
