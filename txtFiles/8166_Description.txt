<p>Mission of Catoosa Citizens for Animal Care (CCAC), Inc.:</p>
<p>Our purpose is to promote the humane treatment of animals through responsible pet ownership.</p>
<p>Goals/Strategic Focus Areas:</p>
<p>1. Reduce the animal overpopulation through our spay/neuter program. For residents of Catoosa County who are in financial need, we pay a portion of the cost of a spay/neuter at <a href="http://wallysfriends.com/">Wally&rsquo;s Friends</a> and <a href="http://dixiedogsandcats.org/">Dixie Day Spay </a>&mdash;both &nbsp;low cost spay/neuter clinics.&nbsp; We also work with the local vets to pay $60 toward the surgery costs for pets whose owners otherwise might not be able to afford it.</p>
<p>2. Educate the community about humane treatment of animals. We offer an educational program in the county schools and supply copies of KIND News in the classrooms.&nbsp; We maintain a 24-hour Help Line (706-937-2287) and our website providing information, resources, and referrals to callers who have a wide variety of questions and needs regarding animal care.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We help connect animals in need of homes with loving families.&nbsp; Also, we have a&nbsp; foster and adoption program in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strive to keep animals in their homes through various resources.&nbsp; In emergency situations <em>we help with medical care for those in financial need</em>.&nbsp; We do not provide assistance for anything that is not medically necessary or that we consider inhumane.</p>
