<p>&nbsp;Robin&rsquo;s Nest of Indy is a small, in-home rescue located in the Geist area (northeast) Indianapolis. Our focus is on unwanted or stray pregnant cats and litters of kittens. We provide a safe and loving environment for our rescued cats and give our Mom cats the prenatal care and nutrition needed to deliver healthy kittens. We make available comfortable and quiet settings where they can give birth to their kittens and post-natal care so that they can nurse wholesome kittens. Post-natal care includes vaccinations and spaying once the kittens are weaned. Our kittens are provided vet examinations, vaccinations and adopted into loving and committed families.&nbsp; Mom cats stay at our home where they get regular interaction with family and other animals until we can find them a suitable forever family. </p>
