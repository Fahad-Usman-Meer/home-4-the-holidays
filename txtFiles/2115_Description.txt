We have constructed a brand new facility that opened up on June 29, 2012, with the cats being housed there.&nbsp; The dogs were brought in as of January 19, 2013, when the new dog kennels were put up.&nbsp; Please go to our website at www.lakeshorehumanesociety.org to look at the pictures of our adoption center in the Adoption Center Gallery as the construction began.&nbsp; Check out our Pet Adoption Gallery showing all our animal orphans looking for their forever homes.
