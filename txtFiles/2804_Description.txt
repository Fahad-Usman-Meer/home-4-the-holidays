<h3>Saving little lives by:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>finding homes for unwanted animals</li>
	<li>promoting spaying and neutering of pets</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why spaying and neutering are essential</h3>

<p>First, and most importantly, spaying and neutering your pet greatly reduces the population of unwanted animals who would otherwise die of starvation, disease or eaten as prey.</p>

<p>Just as important are the health benefits. According to the <a href="http://www.aahanet.org/"> American Animal Hospital Association</a>, early spaying in females greatly reduces the risk of mammary cancer and urinary disease. Early neutering will eliminate male spraying, minimize the desire to roam or fight and will significantly reduce the incidence of prostate and testicular cancer.</p>

<p>Pets should be spayed or neutered between 4 and 6 months of age, before they either go into heat or start to spray. This procedure can be done after this age, but it may take a few weeks before their hormones stabilize and you begin to see the benefits.</p>

<p>Five million dogs and cats are put to death every year because they cannot find homes. You can help prevent these needless deaths by spaying and neutering your pets and by encouraging friends and family to do the same. You can also help by finding room in your hearts and homes for a homeless animal. Please adopt, or consider fostering, a homeless dog or cat.</p>
