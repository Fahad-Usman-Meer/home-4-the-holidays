Liberty Humane Society, located at the entrance to the historical Liberty State Park in Jersey City, NJ, just celebrated its 10th year of shelter and assistance to animals in need.

Liberty Humane Society's beginnings were in a converted garage.  With the help and support of our leadership, staff and generous donors and volunteers, our shelter can now house 50 dogs and 120 cats with 14 outdoor dog runs and several large pens that provide our dogs with daily exercise and sunshine.  

The shelter has two floors.  One designated strictly for the dogs with the second floor providing security and privacy for the many cats and kittens that we shelter.

Being an inner-city shelter, Liberty Humane Society deals with some unique situations including pit bull breeding and a signficant feral cat population.

Liberty Humane Societ is a resource to the community in dealing with this problems with our low-cost spay neuter program; TNR; free pet food and supplies for low-income residents and our Humane Education Program to better educate the next generation.
