<p>The Humane Society of McCormick County is a private, non-profit, no-kill organization. It was created to help McCormick County, South Carolina residents and animals because McCormick County does not have&nbsp;animal control or&nbsp;a county or city-run shelter. The county does not even have a veterinarian. We are the sole source for animal care in our county.&nbsp;HSMC is comprised entirely of volunteers dedicated to the prevention of cruelty to animals, to providing shelter and care for lost and unwanted animals, to implementing educational programs and services, to placing animals in humane environments, and to promoting responsible pet ownership including spay and neuter. www.mccormickcounty.petfinder.com www.Facebook.com/Humane.Society.of.McCormick.County</p>
