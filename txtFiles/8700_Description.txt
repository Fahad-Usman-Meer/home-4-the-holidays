Established in 1938, the purpose of the Santa Cruz SPCA is to ensure the best possible quality of life for animals and to promote respect and reverence for all through adoption, rescue, education, prevention and legislation. A 501c3 non-profit charity, we do not receive any federal, state, or local government funding and exist on donations alone.
