<p>Mission Statement:&nbsp; HELP Humane Society is a 501(c)(3) corporation committed to ending the suffering and killing of homeless, abused and neglected animals by rescuing, sheltering, rehabilitating and seeking forever families for these animals and educating the public on proper pet guardianship and the importance of spaying and neutering.&nbsp; HELP Humane Society sanctuaries the animals that are deemed unadoptable either due to the animal&rsquo;s physical or psychological circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Vision Statement:&nbsp; HELP Humane Society envisions a day when there are no longer companion animals being neglected and&nbsp;abused but each has a warm safe family that surrounds them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all companion animals born are adopted into loving forever homes.&nbsp;&nbsp; A day when no dog is chained outside day after day.&nbsp; A day when a litter of kittens doesn't mean others will die.&nbsp; A day when all pet owners are proud to say their pet is spayed or neutered.&nbsp; We envision a day when feral cat colonies are few and far between.&nbsp; HELP Humane Society envisions the day when no healthy, treatable companion animal is killed to make space for another.&nbsp; We envision a day when our services are no longer needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP Humane Society is a TRUE NO Kill Animal Shelter that focuses mainly on animals that need medical and&nbsp;psycological rehabbing, ones that have NO chance in a kill shelter.&nbsp; This is particularly hard on finances but every life is precious and should be given the chance to live the life they were given.&nbsp; Our animals free roam in the shelter, so their personalities are able to blossum without 24/7 confinement.&nbsp; We are TRUE&nbsp;No Kill in that we do not kill FeLV or FIV+ cats, they are still given the chance they deserve also.&nbsp; No animal is killed.&nbsp; We do euthanize animals if the veterinarian tells us that there is nothing else that can be done and the animal begins to suffer, then a volunteer holds their paw until an angel takes our place, this is not something that is taken lightly, all avenues are explored before we make the decision to help an animal cross to&nbsp;The Bridge&nbsp;</p>
