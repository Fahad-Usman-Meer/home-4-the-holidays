<p>K-9 Angels Rescue is committed to rescuing and re-homing shelter dogs in and around the City of Houston, regardless of their breed or circumstance. We are motivated by the dire need to educate the public about the effects of irresponsible breeding practices, while helping the community by alleviating overcrowding in area shelters.<br />
