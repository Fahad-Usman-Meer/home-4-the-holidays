Cat Guardians, Inc was opened in 1988 by director Kathy Blackwell in a two-story white clapboard house <a href="/contact">near the corner of St. Charles and Westmore Rd. in Lombard, Illinois</a>. The shelter has seen over 2000 cats adopted from the shelter, where they have been nursed back to health or at least avoided the need to scavenge garbage or prowl for prey in the wilds of suburban Chicago.
<p>Cat Guardians does not employ euthanasia, except in extreme circumstances in which medical conditions are such that prolonging a cat&rsquo;s life would no longer be humane. Due to its no-kill policy, Cat Guardians is usually filled to its legal capacity of feline residents. Today, some <a href="cats-for-adoption">50 cats</a> and a rotating population of <a href="/kittens-for-adoption">kittens</a> reside at Cat Guardians shelter. Although some cats and kittens are caged for their protection (due to illness, skittishness, aggression or their young age), most roam freely, having the freedom to play or nap in their choice spots.</p>

These cats are assured of a loving, permanent home at Cat Guardians.</p>
<p>The daily activities of the shelter are feeding the cats, administering medication, cleaning the litter boxes and the shelter, are performed with the help of volunteers and funded through supporters like you.<br />
