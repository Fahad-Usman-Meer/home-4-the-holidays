<font face="Comic Sans MS">PupSavers.org rescues puppies from areas in NM, NE, and KS overpopulated with puppies and transfers them to CO. We're a foster based rescue so we do not have a facility. The puppies we rescue enjoy all the luxuries of home! They receive good nutrition, lots of attention and love, a warm bath and medical care as needed. The pups enjoy watching tv with the foster families and going to pick up the kids at school. All of our puppies are rescued because they would be euthanized. PupSavers.org has adoption events every Sat. (PetCo @ 120th &amp; Sheridan Broomfield) to find homes for all of our pups. Email us for adoption details. Visit pupsavers.org website to see our adorable adoptables and download adoption documents. </font>
