The specific objectives and purposes of Throwaways' include raising funds in order to facilitate our goal of increasing the quality of life of our domestic and wild animal population by providing education, medical services, and an improved habitat for them.&nbsp; We provide spay and neuter services for families who cannot afford to spay/neuter their animals.&nbsp; Additonally, many senior citizens feed &quot;community&quot; or feral cats but cannot afford spay/neuter: in these cases we also provide trap-neuter-release services.
