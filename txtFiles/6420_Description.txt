I am an Edgar County Humane Association Volunteer with our Shelter.  We are a High kill shelter.  Last year(2008) there were 460 dogs euthanized in this county shelter.  Since our organization has started working very hard to place the dogs, we have had 25 due to age or sickness.  A lot of our dogs are going to the organizations listed on this sight in Illinois.  We have even gotten help from Pilots-n-paws. We are doing our very best to adopted or get our dogs to other rescue organizations to save lives.  We would appreciate any help we can get.  Thank you.
