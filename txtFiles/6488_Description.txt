We strive to adopt out healthy, well adjusted kitties of all ages.  We work with our communities to offer *low cost vaccine clinics*pet food bank(Dudley's Delectables) and give wanted/needed advice on kitty care.  We are an all volunteer organization & work out of volunteer foster homes- without awesome volunteers we would not exist!
