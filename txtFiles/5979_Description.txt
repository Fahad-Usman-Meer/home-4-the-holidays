<p>Pet Adoption Network works with the local humane society and surrendering owners to find home for dogs that might not do well in a shelter environment. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, micro-chipped and up to date on their shots when placed. We are a tiny three family rescue group, but with the help of a few resident fosters, we help an average of 50-75 dogs a year find new forever homes.</p>
