our no kill non proft rescue/sanctuary is located in a very small area. this is the first of its kind in this area . to date we have saved around 60 animals.&nbsp; wee are on rented borrowed land utilizing two donated old trailers put together to give cats one side and dogs another. We have no support from lincoln county the city of kemmerer or town of diamondville. we operate with less than a handful of volunteers and less than 5,000 a year . But we have saved many pets from euthanasia and helped out several homeless families with their pets until they get a roof over their head. We are doing the best we can with what we have to work with and the lack of monetary donations and volunteers.. All of our animals are happy and healthy. We are making a difference .
