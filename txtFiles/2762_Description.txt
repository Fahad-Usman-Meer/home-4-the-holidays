&nbsp;The Companion Animal Association is a nonprofit, volunteer-based no-kill pet rescue located in central Indiana, USA. We are dedicated to finding great homes for homeless dogs and cats.<br />
<br />
All of our pets are spayed/neutered (if old enough), vaccinated, dewormed and started on a flea prevention program prior to adoption. Adult dogs are tested for heartworm prior to adoption.
