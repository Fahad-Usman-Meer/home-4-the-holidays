Almost Home Adoptions for rescued cats is filled with loving cats and kittens of all shapes and sizes who would like nothing more than a permanent, loving home. Some have never had a home, and others have been abandoned or surrendered by their previous owners. Some are victims of divorce, illness, allergies, a new baby, inexperienced owners, a move that didnâ€™t include them --and many other reasons. These cats and kittens would be very grateful to have a second chance at a happy life that includes their own special human family. A sad fact of life is that there are far more homeless cats and kittens than there are responsible, loving homes to care for them. 

When you adopt from Almost Home Adoptions for rescued cats, you save a life, you do your part in combating pet overpopulation, and you free up a space for another cat or kitten waiting to be adopted. Your adoption fee goes toward running the adoption center, pet education, medical care and spay/neuter surgery. All of this-- and you gain a 
loving companion too!

Almost Home Adoptions for rescued cats is a 501c3 non-profit organization, committed to finding loving homes for rescued cats and kittens.

Stop by our cage-free adoption center, meet all our furry friends, and see who falls in love with you!
