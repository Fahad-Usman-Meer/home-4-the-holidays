Homeward Bound is a private, nonprofit organization concerned with the welfare of dogs and other animals. We are dedicated to the sheltering and fostering of homeless and unwanted animals. In addition, we take pride in the fact that we are a no-kill rescue and placement program that does not euthanize our animals if they are not adopted within a certain length of time. Homeward Bound has been in existence since 1991 and has rescued well over 15,000 dogs, cats, and other animals.&nbsp; Homeward Bound promotes responsible adoption and care of companion animals. We seek out well matched permanent homes for our loving and deserving<br />
animals.
