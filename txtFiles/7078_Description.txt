<p>Wayward Paws, Inc. is a 501(C-3) Not-For-Profit Cat Rescue Organization that services Onondaga County.</p>

<p>All of our cats and kittens&nbsp;are fostered in private homes. We have both adult cats and kittens for adoption. Our cats and kittens are available for adoption for a nominal fee which includes&nbsp;testing for FeLV/FIV, treating for parasites and fleas, vaccinating against distemper and rabies, and spay and/or neuter.</p>

<p>We also help feral and semi-feral cats by providing vaccinations and spaying and/or neutering&nbsp;through a TNR program.</p>
