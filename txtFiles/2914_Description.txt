<p>The Monroe County Animal Control Shelter has many breeds of stray and abandoned animals for adoption to the general public. The sale of any county owned animal is at the option of the Animal Control Department. Before an animal is placed into a new home all stray animals shall be held pursuant to law in order to give the original owner a chance to claim their pet. Some animals may not be offered for sale after the legal holding period, if in the opinion of the Department the pet is either sick, injured, has vicious tendencies or a condition which may be detrimental to the pet or the human and animal population of the community. These animals may be held and treated or euthanized at the discretion of the Department. Persons purchasing animals which have been kenneled in any facility should be aware that these animals may have been exposed to certain diseases either prior to or at the time of confinement. Some animals may appear healthy at the time of sale however subsequently show signs of illness and need medical attention. Thus an animal purchased should be checked by your veterinarian within 2 days to assure timely provision of it's health needs. Thousands of our animals have been adopted into new homes and enjoy normal, healthy lives. The staff at the shelter will be happy to assist you in choosing a pet to fit your needs. If you are interested in any of the animals please call the Animal Shelter at 240-3125. Please have the AC# available. </p>
