<div><span style="COLOR: black">Animal Resource Network Incorporated Inc. (ARNI) is a non-profit, non-shelter, animal welfare organization. &nbsp;Most of the pets placed by ARNI are released by private owners, shelters, or animal control facilities.&nbsp;ARNI was incorporated in 1997 and has placed more than 2,500 pets.&nbsp;Most of the 2,500 pets have been dogs and cats, but we have had the occasional bird, ferret, and rabbit.&nbsp;We do not have a physical shelter.&nbsp;All of our animals accepted for placement are housed and cared for in foster homes until a new permanent home is found.&nbsp;By fostering them in our home, we are able to learn about their personalities and behaviors and match them to their new prospective family.</span></div>
