Founded in September of 2006, Animal Rescue Center of Bay County, Inc. is a nonprofit, all volunteer, foster based organization dedicated to helping our local animals that have been abandoned in the Panama City, Florida area. Many of these animals are abandoned due to no fault of their own and deserve a second chance at life. That is what ARC is trying to give them.
