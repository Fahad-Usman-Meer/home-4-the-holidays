<font size="5" face="Arial">The Hermitage Cat Shelter is Arizona's 1st No-Kill, No-Cage Shelter and&nbsp; is a not-for-profit 501(c)3 organization  supported entirely by donations. We are dedicated to the shelter,  protection, and care of homeless cats, especially those that are often  not considered adoptable by other organizations. We are both an adoption  facility and long-term sanctuary for those felines who are  &ldquo;adoption-challenged.&rdquo; including felines who are FIV or FeLV-positive,  and other types of chronic health issues. All of our kitties roam free  within 8,000 sq ft of outdoor/indoor living space.</font>
