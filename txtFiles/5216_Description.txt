Colony Cats adoption center is an open space, cage free environment for 80+ cats to live until they are adopted. We are located in a popular shopping center which generates a lot of foot traffic.  We have over 300 cats and dogs in our foster care network. Our felines come from kill shelters, pets abandoned at the feral colonies our volunteers care for, and strays in danger on the street. We offer tnr and spay neuter resources to the community as well as assistance in keeping pets in their homes. We are an all volunteer organization in central Ohio.
