<p><strong>we are not a shelter that accept cats or dogs. we are a rescue group composed of&nbsp;volunteers who help to foster&nbsp;these animals. then bring them to adoptions and place them on petfinders to find them good homes. we hold adoptions at a nearby&nbsp;Petco or Petsmart&nbsp;store. we are always in need of people to help foster these animal.</strong></p>
