<h2><span style="font-size:28px">Who We Are</span></h2>

<p>The Ulster County SPCA is an independent no-kill shelter serving Ulster County. That means that we are a private, nonprofit organization whose mission is to prevent cruelty to animals by providing temporary shelter and finding adoptive homes for homeless, abused and neglected animals. We have officers who conduct cruelty investigations throughout Ulster County, and we are working to eliminate the crisis of homeless animals by providing low-cost spay/neuter services for cats and by spaying in addition to neutering all animals offered for adoption. We also provide humane education for schools, groups, and the public at large to help prevent cruelty. Because we also believe that it is important to improve the local, state and national laws concerning animal cruelty our staffs do our part to educate lawmakers on the issues.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:28px">Adopting a Friend</span></p>

<p>Every animal that Ulster County SPCA adopts out receives all of their inoculations that their age allows. We also de-worm and spay or neuter before they go home. All of our cats are tested for Feline Leukemia and Feline AIDS. Out dogs receive a Heartworm/ Lyme/ Ehrlichia Test (if they are old enough).</p>

<p><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>Adoption Fees</strong></span></p>

<p>Cats: $50.00, Kittens (under 6 months): $85.00<br />
Dogs: $175.00, Puppies (under 1 year): $250.00<br />

<p>We accept Cash and Credit Cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover) for the adoption fees.</p>

<p>If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application and drop it off. To ensure a perfect fit we ask that everyone living in the house meets your perspective pet. Once approved an adoption counselor will set up a time to review the history of animal and to finalize the adoption!</p>
