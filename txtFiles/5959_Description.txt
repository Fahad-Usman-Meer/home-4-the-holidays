The Loving Home Rescue and Adoption shelter, is&nbsp;a non-profit 501.3c organization, located in Fountain Inn, South Carolina. We are a <strong><em>NO KILL</em></strong> rescue where the life of every animal that crosses our path is important to us. Loving Home Rescue strongly feels that euthanasia should be used for sick, and/or dangerous animals or for humanitarian reasons to end suffering--not because an animal is not cute enough or pretty enough to be adopted. <br />
<br />
Loving Home Rescue&rsquo;s goal is to find a happy home for all animals. Because we are non-profit group, we work solely from donations. We spay and neuter our animals and ensure all their shots are up-to-date for when they are adopted to their forever home.<br />
<br />
Our passions are the disabled and senior animals- the ones that are discarded because they are not able to chase the ball or run and play like younger dogs; those who have become a &lsquo;burden&rsquo; because they to fail to let their owners know they need to go out; or those who are blind and require a little extra time to be cared for, after all their years of faithful service to their owners.
