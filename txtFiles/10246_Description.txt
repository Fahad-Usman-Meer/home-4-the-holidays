<p>Animal Aid of Branch County (AABC) is an all volunteer 501c3 all breed rescue.</p>

<p>AABC does not have a shelter.&nbsp; All pets are placed in foster families until permanently adopted.</p>

<p>AABC was established in 2007 with the mission of reducing the euthanasia rate at the county&#39;s animal control facility.&nbsp; When AABC was established the euthanasia rate was over 80%.. in 2014 the rate was reported at under 2%.&nbsp; This was achieved by networking with shelters/rescues across Michigan to transfer the dogs we are not able to pull ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year AABC takes in more and more owner surrenders (people losing their homes and unable to afford their pets) and finder surrenders, helping to keep them from ever having to go to the animal control shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The county animal control facility does not take in cats, so all of the felines we get are owner surrender, finder surrender or &#39;dumped&#39; cats/kittens.</p>

<p>In 2014 AABC teamed with two other local rescues to create BARC (Branch Area Rescue Coalition).&nbsp; BARC has developed a low cost spay/neuter program for dogs and cats.&nbsp;&nbsp; Somtething that was not previously available in this area.</p>
