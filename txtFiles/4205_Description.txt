<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-1">Rolling Hills Humane Society was organized in October 2007. An anonymous retired contractor built and donated a well-designed building that has 16 indoor kennels for dogs where they can go inside and outside through their own doggy-door. We also have kennels outside for our larger dogs along with a large fenced in play area for the dogs to interact with volunteers, future families, and other dogs. There is a room inside for cats along with an office, bathing area, and storage room. <br />
</font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="-1">We do not take in strays and unwanted pets. We are a sanctuary for abused and neglected animals. We give them a safe, loving home until their forever home can be found. <br />

<strong>It Makes A Difference <br />
by Loren Eisley</strong> <br />
<br />
A well-known author and poet was working and vacationing on the southern coast of Spain. One morning very early, he was walking along the beach; the sun was just rising. While enjoying the beauty about him, he glanced down the beach and saw a lone figure dancing about. <br />
<br />
Fascinated by this other person celebrating the day that was about to dawn, he moved closer. As he came nearer, he realized that the young man was not dancing, but in one graceful movement was picking objects up from the beach and was tossing them out into the sea. As he approached the young man, he saw that the objects were starfish. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why in the world are you throwing starfish into the water?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If the starfish are still on the beach when the tide goes out and the sun rises higher in the sky, they will die,&quot; replied the young man as he continued tossing them out to the sea. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's ridiculous! There are thousands of miles of beach and millions of starfish. You can't believe that what you are doing could possible make a difference!&quot; <br />
<br />
The young man picked up another starfish, paused thoughtfully and remarked as he tossed it out into the waves, <br />
<br />
&quot;It makes a difference to this one.&quot; <br />
<br />
