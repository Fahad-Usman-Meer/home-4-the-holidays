<p>Rocky Mountain Siamese Rescue is an all-volunteer 501c3 non-profit, no-kill&nbsp;organization dedicated to helping as many Siamese and Siamese-mix cats as we can. We are based in Colorado, but it is our intention to serve the West and Midwest.</p>

<p>As you may imagine, it takes endless amounts of time, money and help from volunteers to keep a rescue running so we can continue to help the cats. Your donations of time, funds and goods are always needed and welcome. We have many different volunteer opportunities to fit your talents and availability. You do not need to be in Colorado to help us - we have things volunteers can help us with from a distance too!</p>

<p>We also ask that you spread the word about our organization to your friends and family. We are always in need of volunteers and supporters to help our important cause.</p>
