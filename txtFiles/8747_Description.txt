<p>Our totally volunteer operated Humane Society has served Gananoque and the former Front of Leeds areas since 1989. Since 1992 we have been a full service affiliate of the Ontario SPCA, managed by an elected Board consisting of local members of the communities we serve. We rescue, rehabilitate and re home about 300 dogs, cats and other small domestic pets annually. In our history we have never euthanized a healthy adoptable pet just to make space in our Shelter for another. Operating costs are raised by our volunteers through adoption fees, donations and continuous fund raising efforts.</p>
