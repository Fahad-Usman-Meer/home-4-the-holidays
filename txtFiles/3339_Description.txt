Gateway Pet Guardians is dedicated to rescuing homeless pets in the St. Louis area, getting them great veterinary care, and finding them forever homes. We are a virtual shelter with all of our pets waiting for adoption in the care of volunteer foster families.<br />
<br />
Gateway Pet Guardians is a 501c(3) tax-exempt organization. Donations are always greatly appreciated and are used to provide veterinary care for our foster pets, some of whom have been badly injured by automobile accidents, cruelty, neglect, or life on the street.
