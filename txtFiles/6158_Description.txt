Animal Allies of Texas is a 501(c)(3) animal advocacy/rescue organization, dedicated to improving the quality of life in our community. Our goal is to build a no-kill shelter on enough land to house not only "adoptable" animals, but "treatable" ones as well - those who need medical care or behavior modification to become adoptable. While working toward this goal, we will also engage in community service and humane education projects to help bring about "humanity championed by thought."
