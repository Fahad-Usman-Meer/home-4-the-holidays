<p>Hum Holllow Hospice is a very small rescue group- mainly 1 person and a few foster families. We often have older orspecial needs pets. I work in a veterinary hospital and pften hear of pets needing homes.</p>
<p>Many of the dogs have had behavioral problems and if succesfully rehabbed find new homes- if their issues make them not adoptable - they have found a safe haven here. The goal is to find every dog and cat a home- there is one out there for them --sometimes it takes a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program is very helpful to us - not only for the numbers, but for the generosity of the Iams company. Rescue is not free or even cheap- it takes compassion and sacrifice- which is while we are so small, it is all we can handle to find homes for each pet that passes our way.</p>
