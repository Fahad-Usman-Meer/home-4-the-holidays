<p>We are an all volunteer, all breed, non-profit, 501 (c) 3, grassroots, hands-on, sometimes unconventional, blood and guts rescue that focuses on dogs scheduled to be euthanized in public shelters, dogs that have been abandoned, or dogs coming from homes who can no longer care for them. We provide transitional housing for these dogs, usually 2 &ndash; 3 weeks, before they are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and finally adopted out to new homes </p>
<p>&nbsp;Currently most of our rescued dogs are in registered foster homes, where they have a chance to relearn their dog skills, and receive love and care. This gives us a better opportunity to observe their behavior and needs, which will make finding them an appropriate home that much easier. </p>
<p>We hold monthly adoption days at the PetSmart store on Fairview Drive and at PetCo on Topsy Lane in Carson City. We also have dogs available from our website on Petfinder (www.dogtown.petfinder.com) every day of the year. Our email is: dogtownrescue@excite.com Phone number: (775) 934-5774 </p>
<p>We have a life-time return policy for our dogs. Because we are so committed to each and every dog we save, we will take the dog back, no questions asked, at any time, should the new owners decide they can no longer adequately care for the dog. We are often asked by other rescue groups to take in their dogs after they have been adopted out, since they do not adhere to this policy. This is just one of the many things that sets us apart from the &ldquo;other&rdquo; groups you may hear so much about. </p>
<p>There are also some other organizations who will ask you for money, but they will refuse to take your dog when you need to find him/her a new home. We accept ALL dogs, regardless of what county they come from. You try calling some other group who may be very successful at soliciting funds from other counties, and ask them if they will help you with your dog&hellip;we think you&rsquo;ll see why we are heads and tails above the rest!&nbsp; <img alt="" src="/FCKeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/heart.gif" /></p>
