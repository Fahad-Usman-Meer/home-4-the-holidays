<p><font size="3" face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Austin Siamese Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization, formerly the Austin Branch of Texas Siamese Rescue. We focus on the 14 breeds of the Royal Thai Family, including Siamese, Balinese, Javanese, Oriental Shorthairs and Longhairs, Birmans, Burmese, Himalayans, Ocicats, Ragdolls, Snowshoes, and Tonkinese. All of the cats fostered in Austin are cared for in private homes by individuals who dedicate their spare time to this effort. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> Our cats come from a variety of backgrounds. Some faced death at the shelter, while others came from abusive and neglectful households. Still others were treasured companions of guardians who could no longer care for them. What they all have in common is a need for a forever home, where they can live their lives as the happy, pampered cats they all deserve to be. We're looking for the perfect inside home for them! </font></p>
