<h2 style="font-style:italic;">Founded in 2007 as We Care Animal Rescue, Hoosier Hooves &amp; Hounds Inc is a private, independent, foster based, &nbsp;501(c)3 Non-Profit NO-Kill Animal Rescue and Adoption Organization governed by a volunteer Board of Directors located in West Central Indiana. We provide shelter to stray, surrendered, abused, and neglected animals and find them permanent loving homes. We keep and care for every animal until a perfect match is found. We offer sanctuary to those animals that are elderly, chronically ill, or otherwise deemed unadoptable. We strive to create an environment which enhances awareness of the humane treatment of animals and focus on helping all animals alike, we do not discriminate age, sex, size, breed, or color. &nbsp;As the voice for the animals, Hoosier Hooves &amp; Hounds brings together like minded, animal focused individuals and groups to educate the public about animal welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;All animals are welcome, pending our availability of room to service the animals.</h2>
