<p><strong>OUR SERVICES</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We do&nbsp; not charge a fee for our services; we rely on donations from the public for funding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We rescue lost, abandoned, or unwanted animals and seek to provide a loving and stable environment for those animals to live in.&nbsp; A member of our group is always on call to assist an owner or municipal entity as required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We provide veterinary care for animals in need and provide spay/neuter services for animals that will be adopted.&nbsp; We stress spay/neuter for population control and will pay the costs of those procedures for any owner who cannot afford it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are a No-Kill Sanctuary and will not euthanise any animal to make room for others.&nbsp; We see each animal through the adoption process or to old age and death.&nbsp; Occasionally an unexpected condition is revealed during the initial veterinary exam and animals with life threatening conditions are kept by us and treated.&nbsp; If an animal is considered &quot;unadoptable,&quot; we will keep it and care for it ourselves.&nbsp; We do everything possible to help those animals achieve comfort and happiness as they live out their lives with us.&nbsp; Only in extreme cases of pain and suffering will an animal be euthanised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Anyone who has ever loved an animal knows the reason we provide these services.</p>
