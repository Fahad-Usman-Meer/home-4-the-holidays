<p>We are not a shelter but a private 501c3 animal rescue group based in Princeton, WV (where our adoptions are done). &nbsp;We do not have a brick and mortar facility but depend on community members to foster animals in our care. &nbsp;We also strive to educate the public on the importance of spaying and neutering pets to help control the animal population in our area. &nbsp;Our local shelter is a high-kill facility and we often pull animals from there to either adopt out or send on trips to larger out-of-state rescues where there are spay/neuter laws in effect and adoptable animals are in high demand.</p>
