<p>The San Gabriel Valley Humane Society has been serving local communities for over 91 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are fortunate to have&nbsp;dedicated staff and volunteers who work many hours to help&nbsp; homeless animals transition to their forever homes.&nbsp; If a frightened little dog needs a lap to cuddle in, or a big dog needs an extra run or playtime, we are there for them.&nbsp; When you adopt from us, you can be comfortable knowing your pet was well cared for and loved during his stay at the shelter. From our dedicated clinic and kennel staff to our front desk staff and volunteers, all have played key roles in welcoming, nurturing, exercising, socializing and caring for your pet until you found each other. Thanks to their efforts, your pet received the care it needed to transition to shelter life and the support it needed to prepare to join yours!</p>
