American Lab Rescue is an all-breed rescue group specializing in Labrador and Labrador mixes. American Lab Rescue is an all-volunteer, <strong>501c3 non-profit organization</strong> devoted to helping homeless dogs from puppy to senior age find loving forever homes. We are a small organization and we operate this rescue in our free time aside from full-time jobs and our families. Our goal is to find the best homes for the dogs in our care. Our Mission is to save as many dogs as we can from local pounds and kill shelters throughout the south while also rescuing dogs in and around the Northeast where we can. Overcrowded conditions forces early euthanasia for many dogs from puppies to seniors, especially in the south. These shelters in the south, known as kill shelters become full fast and we do our best to save as many lives as we can.
