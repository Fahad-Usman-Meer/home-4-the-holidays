<font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" color="#800080" size="3">We are operated by very dedicated directors, loving foster families and the best volunteers. Perfect Paws Pet Rescue operates a successful pet rescue in the Fort Wayne, Indiana area.<br />
<br />
Our mission is to provide a loving, safe, temporary home for dogs, puppies, cats, and kittens coming from unfortunate circumstances; be it a shelter, another rescue, or simply an individual that can no longer care for them. While in our care, we will provide these animals with age appropriate vaccinations including DHLPP, Rabies, and Kennel Cough. Our rescued dogs will be heartworm tested (if old enough) and started on heartworm prevention.&nbsp; Cats will be leukemia tested.&nbsp; All dogs, cats, puppies and kittens&nbsp;will be wormed, and started on flea/tick prevention.&nbsp; All of our rescued pets&nbsp;will be spayed/neutered (if old enough) prior to going to their forever home.&nbsp; If the pet is not yet old enough to be spayed/neutered, a signed spay/neuter contract will be required and a spay/neuter voucher will be provided.&nbsp;We are dedicated to the placement of these neglected, abandoned, or otherwise unwanted dogs, puppies, cats, and kittens into loving, permanent homes. We also hope to educate on the value of spaying/neutering in decreasing pet overpopulation along with proper animal care and responsibility.</font>
