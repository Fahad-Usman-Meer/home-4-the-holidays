<p>We are a nonprofit corporation organized and operated exclusively for educational and charitable purposes. Specifically, this organization has been formed to rescue dogs from abusive situations or who would otherwise be euthanized at high kill shelters. We go into the shelters and determine which dogs we can help. Sometimes it may be a dog that needs medical attention. We rescue them and obtain the appropriate medical care. We make sure they get a microchip so they will always have an identity and that they are spayed or neutered.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Some are given training, if needed, to unlearn bad habits or just to teach them to trust again. At times we rescue dogs running free on streets, most have been abandoned by their owners as there is no response to our efforts to find their owners. In today&#39;s economy we also will take in dogs, where their owners are down on their luck and can no longer afford to keep them. Then through various methods we try to find them forever homes and families.</p>
