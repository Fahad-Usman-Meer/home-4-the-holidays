<p><em><strong>All Texas Dachshund Rescue, Inc.,</strong></em>&nbsp;is made up of a group of volunteers whose primary goal is to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home disabled and otherwise endangered Dachshunds who have found themselves homeless for one reason or another. It is our policy that no dogs will be adopted out without first being spayed or neutered, have had all vaccines updated, are heartworm negative, are on heartworm preventative, and have had all other health issues we consider important to the pet&rsquo;s life addressed that we are able.</p>

<p>All incoming Dachshunds will be placed in temporary foster homes, where they will be evaluated while living indoors with the&nbsp;foster families in a safe and nurturing home environment, until such time as they are ready to be placed in a loving, adoptive, forever home.<br />
<br />
We shall develop and distribute educational material to the public about the Dachshund breed and health issues associated with the breed, with an emphasis on back/spinal injuries.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We shall educate the public on the importance of spaying and neutering, as well as the options available for downed dogs that are alternatives to euthanasia.<br />
<br />
As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, we shall provide financial assistance, as needed, for the costs associated with diagnostic and intervention medical procedures, including spay and neuter, for disabled Dachshunds; provide financial and educational assistance, as needed, for the purchase and use of necessary medical equipment such as wheel chairs (carts); provide sanctuary and adoption services for disabled Dachshunds at risk of destruction due to their disabilities, and provide assistance with the purchase of any other items needed to promote the quality of life of the disabled Dachshund. As we become able financially, we shall help raise and donate money to assist the public and other rescue organizations for downed Dachshund back surgeries.<br />
<br />
We shall always display courtesy and respect toward all volunteers in appreciation for their valuable services, efforts, time, and support that each provides &mdash; strictly on a volunteer basis &mdash; to help rescue these Dachshunds in need.<br />
<br />
We shall, at all times, dedicate ourselves to promoting enhanced teamwork among other rescuers in Texas, and beyond, for the best interest of the dogs.</p>
