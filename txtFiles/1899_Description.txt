The Escondido Humane Society was founded in Escondido in 1915. We  provide animal care, adoption, education and protection services to  north inland San Diego County. EHS has a long and rich history of involvement with  human-animal relationships, caring for more than 5,000 animals a year  and thousands more in the field. <br />
<br />
We are an open-door shelter, so we take in any companion animal in our  area without a home regardless of age, breed, medical or behavioral  needs, or attractiveness to potential adopters. Our donors, volunteers,  foster homes, and staff work together to create a safe, loving haven for  animals. We are  committed to providing a safe haven for homeless pets until they can be  placed into permanent, loving homes.
