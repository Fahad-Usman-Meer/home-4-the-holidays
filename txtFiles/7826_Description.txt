<p>Hiss &#39;N Slither Snake Rescue was started in Oregon to fill the need for education of the public, and caring for unwanted pet snakes. We have continued this education and caring mission after relocating to Idaho. We offer presentations to various groups, including students, scouts and in private homes.</p>
