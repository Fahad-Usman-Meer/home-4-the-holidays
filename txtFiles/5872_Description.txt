Faithful Friends Animal Rescue is a foster based rescue group. We do not own a shelter. The animals we have up for adoption live in foster homes and live &quot;normal&quot; lives while in foster care. This way, we are able to evaluate their personalities, assertain what issues, if any, may need work and what type of forever home would be best. Our goal is to ensure that these animals find their perfect forever home so they never have to worry about being homeless again.
<p>So many great natured, well behaved pets find themselves homeless everyday through no fault of their own and it's incredibly sad to know that many will never have an opportunity to get a 2nd chance. This is what drives the volunteers at Faithful Friends. To aid the unfortunate creatures that cannot speak for themselves. </p>
<p>The animals we have up for adoption were homeless for various reasons. Some come from shelters where they were either surrendered by their owners or where they were taken as a stray. Some come to us directly as strays - lucky enough to have crossed our path. Others come to us because their owners either cannot care for them or no longer wish to care for them. A variety or reasons and in most cases, the reasons have nothing to do with behavior issues. </p>
<p>Faithful Friends is a registered 501(c)(3) charity which means those willing to donate to our cause, have the ability to write off their donations. Donations are the life blood of any rescue organization and help us continue saving many needy animal lives. We know times are tough, but even a small donation would help our cause.</p>
