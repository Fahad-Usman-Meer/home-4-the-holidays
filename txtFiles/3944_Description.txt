The Kamloops Branch of the BC SPCA is an extremely busy shelter receiving over 2000 stray and owner surrendered animals per year.&nbsp; The problem of pet overpopulation is particularly obvious in our area.&nbsp; Almost half the animals we bring in are kittens and puppies.&nbsp; Please help us save lives by making the BC SPCA your first adoption option!
