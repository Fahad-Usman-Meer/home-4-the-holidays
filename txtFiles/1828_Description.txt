New York City Siamese Rescue is an organization of volunteers who find homes for orphaned and abandoned Siamese cats and related breeds, such as Snowshoes, Balinese, Himalayans, and Ragdolls. 

Cats of all ages are available for adoption, from kittens all the way up to geezer-meezers. 

Our cats are fostered in private homes and shown by appointment. To meet them, please complete our application. Once you have returned your completed form and you are approved to adopt, you can make an appointment to meet our foster Siamese cats by emailing us at: nycsiamese@yahoo.com
