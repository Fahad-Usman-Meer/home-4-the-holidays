<p>Heartland Humane Society is located in Yankton, South Dakota and serves the surrounding area as the premier adoption shelter. In the first 8 months of 2013, we were able to rescue almost&nbsp;250 animals that were either strays or unwanted. Our shelter holds our felines and our dogs are in foster care.</p>
