Our MISSION is to find safe, loving permanent and responsible homes for the homeless or soon to be homeless cats and dogs referred to us.
The organization has been in existence since 1993 and has 501)C)3 status with the IRS.
We are operated by volunteers, with full time jobs, who have a passion for helping animals of all ages secure that one lasting home.
We do not have a shelter, but rather keep animals in our network of foster homes until an appropriate family can be found.
Monthly pet adoption weekends are held at Sunset Hills PetsMart.  Throughout the month we recruit and place animals from our homes.
We educate the public on the need to control pet overpopulation, and place all adult animals after they have been properly spayed or neutered.  Our volunteers follow up to see that all puppies and kittens are sterilized at the proper age.
We strive to maintain open communication with all adoptive families and work through any behavior problems that might threaten the placement, with help from an animal trainer/behaviorist.
We feel an obligation to our animals and want to work with owners regarding their return.
Last but always the most difficult, we struggle to raise the funds necessary to provide full medical care for all our animals to ensure they are sent to their new homes fully vaccinated, on a premium dog food, we use Iams, which they have been on in their foster homes and in good health.
