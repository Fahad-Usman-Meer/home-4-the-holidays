Founded in 1961 the Humane Society of Weld County opened the doors to its new facility in September 1999. We are the only 501(c) 3 non-profit animal shelter in Weld County. <br />
<br />
This facility provides care and shelter to over <strong>7,000 homeless and unwanted pets</strong> in our community each year.<br />
<br />
It is a priority of the Humane Society of Weld County to adopt out healthy and behaviorally sound animals to our caring community. Our adoption fees help to offset the cost of evaluation, housing, feeding and medical care for the thousands of animals who need our help every year. It costs the shelter about $25 per day for each animal. <br />
<br />
Most of the animals we receive are dogs or cats, but we also take-in rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, reptiles and rodents. Visit our Animals to Adopt page to see who is currently looking for a new home. Unfortunately, we cannot house injured wildlife or farm animals. <br />
