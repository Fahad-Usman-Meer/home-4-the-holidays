<p class="contenttext" align="justify">Ohio Pro life Animal Rescue, Inc. is a non-profit organization. Our mission is to provide temporary short or long -term shelter to primarily dogs in need of a home due to a crisis their owners are experiencing.</p>

Many of us in the organization were disturbed by the images of all the pets that were not allowed to get on the buses with their families.

We especially want to help those who have lost their homes due to <nobr><a id="GVLINK_1_0_1" class="GVAdLink" href="http://www.savingdoggies.com/#">foreclosure</a></nobr> during this economic crisis</span>.</p>
