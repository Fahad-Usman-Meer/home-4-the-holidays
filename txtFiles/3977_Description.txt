We are a non profit 501c3 no kill animal rescue shelter and a refugee camp for the unwanted, neglected and abused.&nbsp;We do not only rescue the 'easily adoptable' animals,&nbsp;rather we make it our goal to find a balance between those and the cats, dogs, and other companion animals that may need some form of rehabilitation.&nbsp; That may be medical, behavioral, or otherwise as the situation indicates.&nbsp; But it is our firm goal&nbsp;to rehabilitate with the view to rehome as many as possible.&nbsp; Some may take longer than others, but during their stay with us we&nbsp;make every effort to ensure they are loved, cared for, and given whatever they need to recover.&nbsp; Please visit our website, <a href="http://www.rfom.org">www.rfom.org</a>&nbsp;for more information&nbsp;
