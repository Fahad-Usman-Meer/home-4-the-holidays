As of September 2010, over 3,200 retired greyhounds have been placed into forever homes across NS, NB, PEI, and NFLD through GPAC.
Greyhound Pets of Atlantic Canada (GPAC) a 100% volunteer driven, Canadian registered non-profit society, is located in Musquodoboit Harbour, Nova Scotia.
Today GPAC arranges for the dogs to be transported safely in special greyhound transporters by professional dog haulers. The dogs arrive stress free in loads of 30 every 30 to 45 days.
