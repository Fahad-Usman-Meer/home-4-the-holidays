<p>Virginia German Shepherd Rescue is an all- volunteer, non-profit organization dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing of the German Shepherd Dog. We provide a safe haven for German Shepherds (and, sometimes, other breeds/mixes) who are left in shelters to await uncertain fate; or owner surrenders (moving, illness, divorce, death, etc.); or are victims of abuse or neglect.&nbsp;&nbsp;We adopt dogs to loving, responsible and secure homes, typically, in Virginia and the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. Since our inception in 2001, we have found good homes for over 3000 dogs.&nbsp; We are always in need of donations for vet bills, more volunteers and foster parents. &nbsp;</p>
