We are a small, all-volunteer, &quot;no kill&quot; cat rescue and adoption shelter located at 873 Park Avenue, Hot Springs, Arkansas.&nbsp; We are registered as Guardian Angels Cat Club but now are doing business as Guardian Angels Cat Rescue and Adoption Shelter.&nbsp; We typically adopt over 100 cats per year and typically house 100 or less cats in our &quot;cageless&quot; cat environment (we do use isolation areas and isolated medical cages).&nbsp;
