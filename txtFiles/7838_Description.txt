Tails of Hope Rescue, Inc. is dedicated to giving homeless pets a second chance at life. Many of our pets come from animal control facilities where death is the only alternative. 

We also assist by offering a Low Cost Spay/Neuter Program to our community to help reduce the number of unwanted litters that could end up at animal control.
