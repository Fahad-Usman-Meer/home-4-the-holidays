<p><strong><em>NBAS</em></strong> is an all-volunteer animal rescue group located in the Columbus, Ohio, area. We work to rescue, rehome and rehabilitate homeless dogs and cats. We rely souly on donations from the public.</p>

<p>Currently we are using a foster care system to take care of the cats and dogs that need our help finding their forever home. We&#39;re always in need of foster homes in order to save more pets, and welcome applications for new foster families. Please visit our website at <a href="http://www.newbeginningsas.org">www.newbeginningsas.org</a> and fill out an adoption questionnaire or foster application if you are able to help any of our wonderful fur friends.</p>
