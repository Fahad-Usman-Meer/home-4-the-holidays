<p>LOYAL Rescue was founded with the determination that we will help any dog in need that we can &ndash; regardless of breed, age, medical condition place of birth. Our mission is to find homes for dogs that find themselves homeless, either through abuse, neglect, being abandoned, born or living in a mass breeding facility. We feel a responsibility towards these unfortunate animals, and work to find new permanent, loving, forever homes for them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
LOYAL Rescue also works to improve the rights of dogs and to rescue them where they have been abandoned or abused by their owners. When rescued the dog will be well cared for in private homes, and fully vetted prior to adoption. When LOYAL Rescue finds a loving, caring forever home, the dog will be placed with that home.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
LOYAL Rescue will share, educate and advocate for new information on and improved laws related to canine welfare. LOYAL Rescue is dedicated to helping all abused dogs and in particular rescuing dogs from Mass Breeding Operations.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
LOYAL Rescue will raise funds by any lawful means whatsoever, including requesting contributions from members of the public, adoption fees of rescued animals when placed in forever homes, raffles, and private donations. LOYAL Rescue is a &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo; operation and all funds will be allocated to canine welfare.</p>
