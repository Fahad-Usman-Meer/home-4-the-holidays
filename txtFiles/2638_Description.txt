<p>The Humane Society of North Central Iowa is a non-profit organization funded solely by donations. We are a limited intake (&quot;no-kill&quot;) facility serving North Central Iowa. We promote humane education and spaying and neutering your pets. We receive no money from the state or city...we rely on your generous donations so we can help the animals in need in our community and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>We have several pets who have been with us for a LONG time and our number one goal this season is to find homes for those that celebrated Christmas with us last year. They need homes so badly - all the animals do - but as much as we love them, we do not want to spend another Christmas with them. It is our hope that they will all have a Home 4 the Holiday. All our pets that have been with us for more than a year will be marked on Petfinder with a <strong><font size="4">~</font></strong> before their names.</p>
