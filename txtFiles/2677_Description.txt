We are a homebased Rabbit Rescue in Central Virginia dedicated to finding forever homes for all rabbits.&nbsp; We have many different types of rabbits, from your small Netherland Dwarfs to your large Californians.&nbsp; We have Mini-Rexes and Lops too.&nbsp; We are always rescuing more bunnies so the types change often.&nbsp; We even take in special needs bunnies too.&nbsp; We have four young kids ourselves, so our bunnies are kid friendy!&nbsp; Please let us know if we can help you find the perfect bunny for you and your family!
