Roxies Fund, Inc. is an all-breed dog rescue group that takes dogs from high-kill shelters, spays or neuters them if necessary, updates their shots, and takes care of any other medical needs they might have.&nbsp; Then we place them in foster homes until we can find them their &quot;forever&quot; home.&nbsp; We have recently expanded into rescuing reptiles as well.
