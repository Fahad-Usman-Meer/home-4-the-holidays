<p><strong>Don't miss the ARF SEPA&nbsp;Home 4 the Holidays Adopt-a-Pet Store this holiday season!</strong>&nbsp; Our idea for Home 4 the Holidays is to open a &quot;pet store&quot; full of homeless adoptable pets.&nbsp; Located right on Baltimore Pike in the heart of Media, ARF SEPA's store will be open Thursday and Friday evenings, as well as all day Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; Stop by to meet our adoptable pets, make a donation or find out how you can help.&nbsp; Please check back to see our schedule of events, including our grand opening, photos with Santa, holiday reception and more.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Animal Rescue Foundation of SE PA, Inc.</strong> is an all-volunteer 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that rescues pets from area public shelters that must euthanize when full.&nbsp; Rescued cats, dogs and rabbits receive complete veterinary care - including testing, vaccinations, spay/neuter and even a microchip ID, paid for by ARF SEPA.&nbsp; We will also provide any extra needed veterinary care, such as surgeries, medications and training if&nbsp;needed to help pets get healthy and ready to be adopted into permanent, loving homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All pets reside in a home with a foster family until adopted - as long as that takes. &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ARF SEPA&nbsp;also holds free mobile spay/neuter clinics in areas that have high numbers of strays (especially cats) turned in to area shelters.&nbsp; Many residents of these areas do not have the financial means to spay/neuter, and they often&nbsp;do not have transportation to veterinary clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;A mobile spay/neuter unit solves both issues and helps address the problem of pet overpopulation at its core by spay/neutering in areas where it's needed most.&nbsp; At our most recent clinic, we spay/neutered 52 cats in just one day!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an all-volunteer organization, administrative costs are kept low and the focus is solely on animal welfare.&nbsp; Our more than 100 volunteers routinely give up their evenings and weekends to work outreach events, speak to the public, care for pets and process adoptions.&nbsp; Our volunteers regularly patrol area public shelters looking for pets that need a second chance at a loving home.&nbsp; So far in 2006 we have exceeded our goals and&nbsp;rescued&nbsp;more than&nbsp;400 cats, dogs and rabbits!&nbsp; We're&nbsp;excited to work for Home 4 the Holidays and save even more lives this holiday season.&nbsp; <strong>Our aim is for the public to think rescue first when looking for a companion pet for their home.&nbsp; &quot;Make a difference in a pet's life.&nbsp; Think rescue first!&quot;&nbsp; www.arfsepa.com</strong></p>
