Another Option Cat Rescue (AOCR) is a small, No Kill rescue in Blount County, Alabama. We have limited space but all of our rescues remain with us for however long it takes to find them a home. All expenses are paid out of pocket. We are working on getting our 501(c)3 Nonprofit Status and are looking forward to the day when we achieve this dream.
