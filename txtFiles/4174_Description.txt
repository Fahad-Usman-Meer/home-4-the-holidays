<p>The Atascosa Humane Society rescues mostly from the local Animal Control Facilities. That is what we focus on most to rescue the animals before the get put down. We have a cozy shelter for cats &amp; kittens. All of our Rescue Dogs are in Foster Homes which works out wonderful. The dogs get lots of love, play time and one on one contact. <img alt="" src="/FCKeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/teeth_smile.gif" /></p>
