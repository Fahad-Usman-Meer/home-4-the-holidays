Second Chance 4 Pets Network&nbsp; was formed in February 2012 to help people help animals.&nbsp; Our focuses will be on reducing pet overpopulation by spaying/neutering free-roaming strays, rescuing orphaned animals and helping them find new adoptive homes, providing low-cost vaccinations, spay/neuter services and pet food to those owners in need, assisting in the rehoming of pets, and community education.&nbsp;
