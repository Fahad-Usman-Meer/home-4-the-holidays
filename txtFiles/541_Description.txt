<h3>Who We Are...</h3>
The Humane Society of Port Jervis/Deerpark is a non-profit, full service shelter that was established in 1959 by Mr Robert Kleinstuber as a memorial to his wonderful dog Jeff. We provide shelter for all types of creatures and never turn away an animal in need. With our &quot;open door&quot; policy, we receive and care for approximately 3,800 lost and unwanted animals each year.
<h3>Adopting a Friend...</h3>
Our staff is eager to match animals with appropriate adopters, but strict guidelines are followed to assure the animal is welcomed into a suitable home environment to become a companion for life. An important part of our adoption program is a 24 hour &quot;cooling off period&quot; to prevent impulse adoptions. We like to adopt only to people within a 60 mile radius of Port Jervis, NY. <hr />
