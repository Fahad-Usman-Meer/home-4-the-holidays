<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting our Home for the holidays page! We are the local animal shelter for Montcalm County Michigan, we accept every animal that is brought to us and then work our very best to place each animal in a loving forever home! We understand the value of spaying and neutering as well as offering the public healthy and sterilized adoptable pets, se each on of our adoptable animals is fully vaccinated and spayed/neutered before going home. We also accept all domesticated animals, so were not limited to just cats and dogs, each year we find homes for many other animals such as guniea pigs, pet birds, ferrets, chickens, cows, horses and pigs! Every penny donated is used to help the animals in our shelter, whether its for purchasing food and treats or life saving medical care it is always very helpful and we are greatful for each donation we receive! Thank You!!</p>
