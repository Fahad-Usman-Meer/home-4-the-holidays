<font size="2"><font color="#000000">GPA Tampa Bay is dedicated to promoting and facilitating the adoption of Greyhounds when their racing careers end, and to educate the public about Greyhounds and what wonderful pets they can become. Prior to adoption, all of our dogs are spayed or neutered, bathed with a flea shampoo, de-wormed, heartworm tested, vaccinated, and have their teeth cleaned. GPA Tampa Bay cares for the animals from the track to their new homes, using our network of foster homes where loving volunteers help them learn the trials and tribulations of life after the track. GPA Tampa Bay is run entirely by volunteers and depends on fundraising and donations for its operating expenses.</font></font>
