<p>Company Overview: RescueCats, Inc. - Kitten and Cat Rescue &amp; Adoptions RescueCats is one of the few rescue groups that are truly a no-kill facility and very proud of our accomplishments.</p>

<p>Mission: RescueCats is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, state-licensed, no-kill group dedicated to rescuing owner released and homeless kittens and cats. To prevent pet overpopulation, we have all kittens and cats spayed or neutered, and we provide a safe and loving shelter until stable, loving homes can be found. We work very hard to be a role model for other groups and educate the public about the necessity of spaying and neutering and proper care of animals.</p>
