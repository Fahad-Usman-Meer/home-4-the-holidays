<h5><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">We are Doggie Kamp Rescue and Rehab, Inc. </span></h5>
<h5><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Our mission is to find wonderful, loving homes for our wonderful dogs. We are a no kill dog sanctuary. Our facility is a non-traditional rescue. The dogs get to just be dogs out here on 11 acres. They run and play all day. They are only in kennels to eat and sleep. We hope to find all of our dogs homes this year, please help us make this possible.</span></h5>
