<p><font size="3">Abby Animal Sanctuary is a no-kill, non-profit animal sanctuary that rescues abandoned dogs and cats. The volunteer-based sanctuary will be located in Southern California and will be supported by donations. The primary goal of the sanctuary is to decrease the number of homeless, abused and abandoned dogs and cats in the Los Angeles area. While the sanctuary raises funds to acquire property, <em><strong>we are actively seeking foster homes</strong></em> to take care of our newly rescued animals until we find them forever homes.</font></p>
