Nashville Cat Rescue is a network of foster homes dedicated to rescuing cats and kittens from off the streets and from high-kill shelters and adopting them into loving homes.&nbsp; All of our animals are spayed or neutered prior to adoption.&nbsp; Since we don't have a facility, we adopt our cats out of two PETsMART locations.&nbsp;
