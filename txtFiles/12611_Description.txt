<p>The Middleburg Humane Foundation (MHF) operates a private, non-profit, 4.5-acre farm shelter located in Marshall, Virginia. It is our goal to provide a safe haven for abused, neglected, and &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; animals, both large and small.</p>

<p>MHF specializes in the rescue and rehabilitation of animals that come to our shelter from a vast variety of abusive situations.&nbsp; After much needed nurturing and medical care, our animals are placed available for adoption.</p>
