Our mission is to provide shelter, food, medical and physical care to homeless, abandoned and abused animals of south central Iowa.

We also promote and encourage our community to spay/neuter their animals to help control the pet population. In our efforts, we help provide assistance to pet owners who need help with necessary expenses to provide a healthy environment for their beloved pets. We believe every domestic animal deserves a happy and healthy life in a good home.
