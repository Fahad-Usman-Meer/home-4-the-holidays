I started my rescue in 2008 on my birthday.  In returning from Jellico, TN over a rural mountain road I rescued 6 newborn puppies. In 2009 I became a 501c3 organization with the IRS and chartered by the State of TN.

My husband funds the rescue with his retirement and we still struggle to do the things we need to do for the pets in our care. We get very little in the way of donations from the public.

We continue to seek volunteers, sponsors and donors to be be able to  socialize, feed and vet our pets for adoptions.
