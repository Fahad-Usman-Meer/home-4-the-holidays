Placing Paws of Illinois is a 501c3 organization founded in June of 2008 with the goal of rescuing unwanted dogs and cats from rural high kill shelters.&nbsp; These animals have no hope of being adopted unless a rescue takes them into their care. Placing Paws fully vets and microchips our animals and places them in foster homes until their &quot;Forever&quot; homes are found.
