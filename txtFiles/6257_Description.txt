Three Sisters Pet Rescue really is 3 sisters! We all live on the west side of Cincinnati and we rescue from high kill and crowded shelters. Once pets come to us they are &quot;safe&quot; and have a chance to live in one of our foster homes while awaiting a forever family. <br />
<br />
We make sure everyone in our care gets the vet care they need. And begins learning basic household manners. Like crate training, leash walking and housebreaking.<br />
<br />
We are always seeking GREAT forever and foster families!<br />
<br />
If you want to help, but&nbsp; cannot adopt of foster one of the pets on our web site, consider sponsoring him or her! For $25 you can pay for shots and deworming.... or a heartworm test.... or contribute toward a spay/ neuter.
