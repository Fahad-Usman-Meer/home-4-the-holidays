<p align="justify"><font color="#339966" size="2" face="Tahoma">Our mission is to work together as a group, and in conjunction with other animal rescue groups, to rehabilitate, medically treat, spay/neuter, shelter, and place each animal we rescue into loving, quality forever homes. We will work to educate the public about the importance of spay/neuter and about proper and humane animal care and breeding. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#339966" size="2" face="Tahoma">Every once in a while an animal we rescue is not adoptable due to behavioral or aggression issues. We give those animals sanctuary for the rest of their lives. We do not euthanize any animal unless recommended by a licensed veterinarian due to an animals incurable medical condition causing the animal unrelievable pain, suffering, and no quality of life.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#339966" size="2" face="Tahoma">We are in desperate need of&nbsp;volunteers and&nbsp;foster homes so that we can continue to rescue animals in need.</font></p>
