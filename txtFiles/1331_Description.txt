<p>The SPCA of Western Quebec is a no-kill, non-profit Animal Shelter which has been serving the community for over 25 years. We rely soley on adoption fees and donations and receive no public funding of any kind.&nbsp; Our Mission is to protect animals against all forms of cruelty; offer them shelter, care and, sometimes, an end to their suffering; educate the population in order to harmonize relationships between man, animal and the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to continue to provide care to the thousands of animals that pass through the Shelter's doors, we ask for your support--both as a volunteer and financial.&nbsp; Please refer to our WebSite for details at www.aylmer-hull-spca.qc.ca</p>
