We are&nbsp;Magic Happens, a rabbit rescue in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana area. We take in unwanted rabbits and rehome them, as well as do educational visits to schools and events. We are a network of foster homes and have no &quot;shelter&quot; building to visit just yet, but if you are looking for a new pet, take a look at our adoptable bunnies online and give these guys a second chance at a loving home!&nbsp; Also check out our website <a href="http://www.magichappensrescue.com">www.magichappensrescue.com</a> for fundraisers, event listings, and a list of our bunny services.
