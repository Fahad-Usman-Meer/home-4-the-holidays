Frankies Furry Friends Rescue is a small group of volunteers and fosters that foster the dogs in our own homes until they are adopted. Our main concern is giving a small breed dog either from a puppy mill or a local shelter a second chance at a life. We offer them a safe place until their forever homes are found. They receive proper food, they learn how to trust people. The foster gives them lots of love and attention, they are microchiped, and all vetting (including spay or neutering, vaccinations, heartworm testing, bordetella and heartworm preventative) they need until their forever homes are found. We educate the public about the importance of spaying and neutering the animals and emphasize the importance of adopting a dog and knowing it is a lifetime commitment. We are run entirely by a group of volunteers. We receive no government support and operate from the funds from our adoption fees, fundraising and generous donations from animal lovers.
<h3>Adopting a friend</h3>
Our adoption fees include: spay or neuter, microchips, testing for heartworm and prevention, and all dogs are up to date on their vaccinations. We will screen each potential adopter including a home visit to make sure the dog will be a match for the family.
