<p>For the Love of Cats, Inc. is a 501c3 non-profit organization located in Marco Island, FL that is dedicated to saving the lives of abandoned cats and kittens in the community. We are a no-kill, all volunteer rescue group operating through the generous donations of the public since 2002.</p>

<p>Our mission is to end the cruelty of pet overpopulation. Donated funds go directly towards our programs that include working with the community to sterilize stray and feral cats through TNR (Trap, Neuter, Return), rescue, foster, sterilization and adoption for kittens and abandoned domestic cats, assisting the public in need with low cost spay/neuter certificates and veterinary fees along with support programs to help people to keep their pets.</p>
