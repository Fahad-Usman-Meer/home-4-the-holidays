<p>Odessa Animal Control is an open admission facility that takes in any animal that is presented to us. We strive every month to increase our adoption numbers and work with more than&nbsp;225 rescue groups around the country! We are taking the necessary steps for a new facility that will help us become a no-kill facility!! Thank you for showing your support to us!</p>
