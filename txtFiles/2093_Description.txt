<p>Lucky Cat Adoptions is an all volunteer 501(c)(3) non-profit cat rescue organization formed in January 2005.<span style="line-height:1.6em">Our mission is to improve the welfare of stray and abandoned cats and kittens throughout the Jacksonville metropolitan area. We aim to achieve this through the rescue, rehabilitation and placement of homeless felines from animal shelters, found stray, abandoned, neglected and/or abused. We strive to educate the public on responsible pet ownership and promote spay/neuter. We are dedicated to end the tragedy of pet overpopulation in our community.</span></p>
