They are regularly maligned by the media, feared and misunderstood by the public, too often owned by abusive or irresponsible individuals, innocent victims of kill policies in shelters, and the target of breed specific legislation and breed bans.&nbsp; In Ohio, a pending bill, HB 568, would euthanize innocent animals across the state. </strong></font></p>

Roughly 30% of impounded pets are reclaimed, adopted or rescued. The remaining 70% are destroyed. The overwhelming majority of these animals are pit bulls.&nbsp; Only ONE out of every six hundred pit bulls born ever gets a loving home. Only one. </strong></font></p>

Pit bulls, in particular, often are not even given the chance for adoption. In many cases, we rescue an animal hours before it is scheduled to be put to sleep, giving the animal an opportunity to be adopted by a loving family and a second chance at life. <br />
