<p>We are a non-profit, no-kill cat and dog rescue organization in Phoenix, Arizona (and surrounding areas).&nbsp; We do not have a shelter/kennel type of environment but rather foster all of our cats and dogs in family homes.&nbsp; We do not receive government or state funding and rely exclusively on donations and adoption fees.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;visit our website (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.valleycatsanddogs.org">www.valleydogs.org</a>&nbsp;)&nbsp;and support our efforts, we know you&#39;ll love what we do!!</p>
