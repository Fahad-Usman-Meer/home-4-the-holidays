<p>Charlies Cat Sanctuary is a group of foster carers who care for&nbsp; orphaned cats and kittens. We have them desexed, microchipped, wormed and flea treated, we then find good homes for them. We hope to have a property soon so that all the cats can be in the one place. We have a no-kill policy.</p>
