<p>Cats Galore practices Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR). We get any wild adults spayed/neutered and vaccinated&nbsp; and return them to their wild colony where a caretaker feeds them, provides shelter if needed, and monitors them.&nbsp; We keep the tame stray adults and tameable kittens, get them sterilized and vaccinate then socialize them and place in adoptive homes.&nbsp; Some of our cats and kittens are strays turned into us, but few are tame cats surrendered by their owners.&nbsp; This is because our TNR cats and kittens generally keep us full to overflowing.</p>
