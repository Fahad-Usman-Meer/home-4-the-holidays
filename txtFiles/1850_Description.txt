The SPCA/Humane Society of Prince George's County, Inc. is a nonprofit organization of volunteers dedicated to animal welfare. We are chartered by the State of Maryland, but we receive no state or county funds. Our activities are supported solely by contributions, dues and fundraising events.
<p class="header2">We have three main objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; To <em><strong>reduce the number of unwanted litters of dogs and cats</strong></em> through our progressive spay/neuter program; </p>
<p>&bull; To <em><strong>prevent cruelty to animals and all animal suffering</strong></em> through humane education, neglect and cruelty investigations, protective legal action, and an active dog and cat adoption program; </p>
<p>&bull; To <em><strong>protect all animals against suffering and abuse</strong></em> through education on legislation effecting the protection of all animals.<br />
