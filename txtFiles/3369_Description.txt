Midwest Dachshund Rescue is a 501 (c) (3) all-volunteer organization that was founded in 2003. It primarily serves Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. We try to serve other Midwest states as resources are available. MWDR is totally committed to rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming needy dachshunds and dachshund mixes throughout the Midwest.
