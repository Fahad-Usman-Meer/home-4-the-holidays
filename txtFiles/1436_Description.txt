<p>Creston Animal Rescue Effort is an all volunteer group that works with the City of Creston at the local city pound. Our group does not take animals in, but rather we give veterinary care to the impounded pets and find new homes for the pets not claimed by their owners. All our work is done outside of our regular full-time jobs so please be patient. Phone calls are returned as quickly as possible and adoption appointments are made primarily on the weekends or around our work schedules. You may also email us mdowney@iowatelecom.net</p>
