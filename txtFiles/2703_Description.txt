<p>The Cat Network is an all-volunteer, not-for-profit, 501(c)3, no-kill and life-enhancing cat rescue group. Since 1991, we have rescued and placed thousands of abandoned, abused, stray and shelter cats and kittens in St. Louis, Missouri and surrounding areas. After their rescue, the cats and kittens are provided medical care, tested for Feline Leukemia and FIV, micro-chipped and spayed or neutered. Cats and kittens are kept in foster care and then placed in loving permanent homes whenever possible.</p>
