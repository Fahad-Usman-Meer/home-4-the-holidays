<p><strong>The SPCA OF HERNANDO COUNTY FLORIDA is a 501.(C)3 non-profit, NO KILL, volunteer, limited space shelter that has been in operation for almost 30 years.&nbsp; Founded by just a few dedicated animals rescuers out of their homes, the SPCA finally obtained approximately 5 acres of land off Sunshine Grove Rd. where the shelter was built, along with the outside screened in porches, the individual dog covered dog runs and the separate thrift shop that sells gently used donated items for resale, 100% of which the profits go right back into the shelter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We receive no money from either&nbsp;the county or state, but operate solely on fundraising events, generous donations from estates, wise banking investments, donation boxes scattered throughout our community and other charity events that help every homeless animal we accept into our shelter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are always in need of reliable volunteers, shelter supplies; food, clay cat litter, trash bags, detergent, bleach, mops, buckets, cotton swabs, office supplies such as copy paper, pens, note pads or even things like gift cards (WalMart, Sams Club, Office Depot, etc.) would be greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
