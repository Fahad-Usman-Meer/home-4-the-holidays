<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The              Atlanta Humane Society is a private nonprofit organization acting              as a regional 	center for the needs of animals, pet owners, and              the Community at large concerning 	animal welfare issues and problems.              We are a haven for the unwanted and abandoned 	with no time limit              on hope--a haven with a heart. The Atlanta Humane Society is <u>much</u>              	more than a shelter--it is a place filled with unconditional love.</font><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br />
