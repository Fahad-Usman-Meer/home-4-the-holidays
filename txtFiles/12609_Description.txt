<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pet Rescue is a 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization founded in 1982 by volunteer workers who met at a &quot;no-kill&quot; animal shelter. Dismayed at the terrible living conditions of the animals there, they left to establish a rescue group to properly care for cats and dogs in need, and find them safe and loving homes.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pet Rescue&#39;s mission is to aid homeless, abandoned and neglected cats and dogs, to nurture them in the foster care of volunteers, to provide veterinary care and socialization, and to place them in permanent loving and responsible homes. Pet Rescue also works to decrease the population of homeless dogs and cats through its spay/neuter programs.</p>
