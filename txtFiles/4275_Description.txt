Neely's Pet Place rescue's unwanted, abandoned, kill shelter and owner turn in's from euthanization on a weekly basis. We strive to make sure our adopted dogs are happy and healthy. All our dogs are socialized with people, children and other dogs to make the adjustment into thier new home as stress free as possible. We currently adopt out from Petco in Sherman, TX every Saturday and Sunday from 11am to 6pm. Stop by and see all our wonderful friends!
