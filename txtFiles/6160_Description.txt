WWACA was organized as a Missouri 501(c)(3) rescue and shelter in November 2008. We started out with two cat foster homes and three dog foster homes. The majority of the animals we rescued were saved from the city pound just before they were to be euthanized. As with most volunteer organizations, it has been an uphill battle finding loyal supporters and volunteers. Two of our board members have rebuilt their farm buildings and house to shelter cats until they can be adopted. They have quarantine and vetting areas plus heated housing and a large enclosed outdoor cat playground.

Next year we will begin to apply for grants and other fundraising events to help us reach our goal of an all-animal shelter so we can rescue animals from the rural county. It has been a struggle, especially since most of our members are seniors using their own funds to take care of the animals. Since January, we have found homes for over 100 dogs and about 40 cats and kittens. However, without funds and the support of the community we fear 2010 will be another uphill battle.
