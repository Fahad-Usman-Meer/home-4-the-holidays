About Recycled K-9 Animal Rescue</font><br />
&nbsp;<font size="4"><font size="3">We have been saving lives since Oct.2002. We have dedicated our time to help out animals of all kinds. We don't discriminate. All breeds welcome. We do try to make our main focus is to the seniors, disabled, and those with medical needs.​  <br />
<br />
Recycled K-9 Animal Rescue is a strict volunteer operated rescue. No one collect a paycheck. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;Since our rescue opened its doors in 2002, we&rsquo;ve treated every animal like they were a part of our family. We strive to make sure not only the best interest of our animals are in place but the best interest in our adopters as well. <br />
<br />
We couldn't do what we do with out the help of our sponsors and volunteers.<br />
<br />
Here at Recycled K-9 we thrive to make sure that abused, neglected, and abandoned animals find their forever homes. <br />
<br />
Although our animals mainly come from strays found wandering the roads or from high kill shelters we make sure each and every animal is temperament tested and goes through basic training before being put up for adoption. We also provide free in home training to all who adopt if any issues should arise later on. (LOCAL TRAINING ONLY)  We have dedicated our time to help out animals of all kinds. We don't discriminate. All breeds welcome. <br />
