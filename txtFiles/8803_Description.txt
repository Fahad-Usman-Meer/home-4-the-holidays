Tri-County Animal Rescue Center rescues needy cats and dogs. We provide the quality care they deserve until we can place them in forever homes where they will be treated as part of the family. In accordance with our no-kill philosophy, we are committed to help reduce pet overpopulation by providing access to low cost spay/neuter programs and pet owner education.<br />
We also maintain a Pet Food Bank for those in need and have an active Facebok page highlighting our pet u pfor adoption and keeping the communithy informed about events, lost/found pets, pet food recalls and more.</p>
