Desert Abandoned Dog Society, aka D.A.D.S., is a non-profit organization that has been set up to help individuals as well as shelters and rescue groups find homes for lost, abandoned &amp;/or abused dogs. We also have Dogy Daze Kennels, which is a low-kill, limited access kennel facility where everyone is welcome to come and meet some pretty wonderful dogs of all ages, sizes and breeds.
