The Delta Humane Society operates in an area of Northeast Louisiana where there is no animal control, shelter or another animal welfare organization.&nbsp;Our efforts depend solely on donations and volunteers and we have no facility. All of our animals are housed with foster families. For more information, email <a href="mailto:help@thedeltahumanesociety.com">help@thedeltahumanesociety.com</a>
