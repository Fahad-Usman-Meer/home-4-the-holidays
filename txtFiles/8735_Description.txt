<h3><strong>FURever FURkids Rescue is a privately run rescue. All FURever FURkids&#39; dogs, cats, small animals, and birds have come from situations such as being on death row at shelters, owners who can no longer keep them, or rescued from terrible situations. Each animal is fully vetted before adoption. The adoption process requires an application with vet references and a contract upon adoption. FURever FURkids started in 2009 and has adopted out hundreds of animals since we began. FURever FURkids has a professional, working relationship as a rescue with area rescues, vets, shelters, and spay/neuter clinics.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
