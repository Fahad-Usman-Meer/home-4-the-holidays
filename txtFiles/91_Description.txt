<h2 style="font-style:italic;">Second Chance Animal Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization established in February of 2000.&nbsp; We rescue, rehabilitate and secure permanent homes for abandoned and abused dogs found on the streets of Puerto Rico.&nbsp;</h2>

<h2 style="font-style:italic;">We provide each rescue with food, shelter, medical care and love!&nbsp; Our goal is to place each rescue into a compatible forever home.&nbsp; We continue to increase our rescue efforts with education regarding the importance of spaying and neutering of pets to subsequently decrease the number of strays that call the streets home.&nbsp; In support of our initiative, we require that each rescue leave our care sterilized and fully vaccinated.&nbsp; It&#39;s our way of taking control of our islands biggest problem...overpopulation.&nbsp; To date, Second Chance houses over 90+ rescues.&nbsp;</h2>

<h2 style="font-style:italic;">We operate exclusively from your donations and animal welfare grants.&nbsp; In addition, our rescue is staffed with dedicated volunteers from the East Coast to the West Coast working together to help meet our unified goal.&nbsp; Our stateside teams operate in a foster care capacity and work closely with the families to ensure a smooth transition for each rescue into their new home.&nbsp; Since its inception, Second Chance has rescued and placed thousands!&nbsp;</h2>
