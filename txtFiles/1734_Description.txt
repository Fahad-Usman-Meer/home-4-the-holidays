<p>Indiana House Rabbit Society is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to improving the lives of domestic rabbits in the state of Indiana.&nbsp; We improve the lives of domestic rabbits through the coordination of local, volunteer-driven <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Education, Rescue and Adoption </span>efforts in our state.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We provide resources to educate the public on&nbsp;the benefits of rabbits as companion animals, rabbit behavior and rabbit care.&nbsp; We provide assistance establishing programs with animal control agencies, shelters, humane societies and sanctuaries to increase their rabbit adoption rates.&nbsp; After we have exhausted all avenues, and provided we have the available resources, we coordinate the rescue of rabbits scheduled for euthanasia and adopt them through our group.&nbsp; </p>
