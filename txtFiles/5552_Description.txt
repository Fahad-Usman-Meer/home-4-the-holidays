4 Luv of Dog Rescue is a no-kill, all-volunteer run, non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing dogs from local pounds, as well as from owners who are no longer able to provide adequate care for their pets.&nbsp; We have no shelter facility in which to house our dogs, so we rely on foster homes to help us care for the dogs we rescue.&nbsp; We do not discriminate based on breed, age, size or possible medical problem.
