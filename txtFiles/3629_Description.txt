13th Street Cats is a small but determined group of volunteers, serving the Northside area of San&nbsp;Jose since 2005 (officially).<br />
<br />
We are dedicated to improving the lives of feral and social cats and in controlling the population by the use of TNR. Trap-Neuter-Release is an effective, internationally recognized program by which cats are trapped, vaccinated, spayed or neutered and returned to their original location to be cared for. Kittens that can be socialized are taken into foster care and are then put up for adoption.
