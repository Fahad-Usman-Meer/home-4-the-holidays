<p>Felines First Rescue is based around just that...FELINES FIRST &amp; RESCUING!&nbsp; We treat all felines as members of our family until it is time to adopt to their new furever families.</p>

<p>Our Mission: Felines First Rescue is a dedicated, no-kill network of volunteers and foster homes striving to help and care for the abandoned, stray, helpless and homeless felines in the Portland Metro area.&nbsp; All kittens are examined by a veterinarian, assessed for any special needs, vaccinated, tested, microchipped and spayed or neutered prior to leaving our care.&nbsp; We believe in every adoption being PURRFECT and&nbsp;FUREVER and are committed to providing post-adoption counseling, education and working as a resource for our community.</p>
