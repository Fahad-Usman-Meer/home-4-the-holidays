<p>Coast to Coast Dachshund Rescue is a National non-profit 501(c)3, all-volunteer&nbsp;rescue organization dedicated to&nbsp;rescuing Dachshunds in need, regardless of health or age, in an effort to find them permanent homes.&nbsp; Our website lists a directory of all the Dachshunds in our care, who are&nbsp;in our foster homes across the country just waiting to find the perfect forever home.&nbsp; Each adoptable dog on our website has a&nbsp;&quot;Bio&quot; so you can find out more about them.&nbsp; Please check out our website for more information on our adoption process and fees, and you can also fill out an adoption contract online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to adopt a dog at this time, check out how you can become a Buddy to our long-term foster dogs.&nbsp; They love getting attention too!</p>
