<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C.A.R.E. is an all volunteer organization that works in conjunction with Evanston's municipal Animal Shelter to find homes for the unwanted and abandoned animals that are brought to the shelter. Since our inception in 1987, C.A.R.E. has been responsible for the adoption of thousands of dogs and cats that would have otherwise been euthanized. C.A.R.E. provides medical treatment and conducts all adoptions for the shelter animals.</font>
