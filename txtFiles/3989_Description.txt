We are a 100% volunteer, no-kill shelter&nbsp;celebrating our 22 year of operation, and&nbsp;happy to still be 100% volunteer with no paid staff whatsoever.&nbsp; All money raised from adoptions and donations go back into the animal's care and comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp; So stop in and adopt or come in and volunteer, we'd love to see you.
