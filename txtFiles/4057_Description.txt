<p>Hi! I work with a rescue group to help find familys for dogs whos time is almost up at the shelter.</p>
<p>The newest one is Blake, he is a shepard/lab mix. I pulled him from NC, where he was scheduled to be put down just 2 hours later! He is about 35ibs, and a little over a year old. If you are interested in hearing more about him, seeing a picture, or meeting him, please send a phone number to <a href="mailto:kiss499@yahoo.com...thanks">kiss499@yahoo.com...thanks</a>!!</p>
