Ferrets are pets too!&nbsp; Lane Area Ferret Shelter and Rescue is a nonprofit, no-kill agency which provides services for stray, abandoned, or otherwise unwanted ferrets. We provide a warm home, food, and medical service to ferrets in our shelter.&nbsp; We ensure that all animals are neutered or spayed before being adopted.&nbsp; We also make sure the pets are up-to-date on their distemper and rabies vaccinations. We have a large number of older animals who desperately would love a new home for the holidays! <strong>Ferret out a friend today!</strong>
