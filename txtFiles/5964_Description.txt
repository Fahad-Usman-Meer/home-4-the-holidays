Canine Soulmates Rescue Group is a all-volunteer, non-profit, no-kill dog rescue and advocacy organization, composed of people from every walk of life.
<p><strong><em>We are committed to a common interest of helping save lives and finding abandoned, abused, neglected, and lost dogs the right &quot;forever home&quot; for their specific needs.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We want to bring an end to the homeless animal tragedy and believe the euthanasia of millions of animals each year is an unacceptable solution. In addition, we believe that our actions within the rescue have a direct effect on this, and we can create change.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>To this end, we so pledge with love and hope.</em></strong></p>
