The Eleanor Sonsini Animal Shelter, Pittsfield&rsquo;s municipal shelter, is managed by The Friends of Eleanor Sonsini Animal Shelter, Inc., a non-profit, 501(c)(3) public charity. We are dedicated to re-uniting stray animals from Pittsfield with their owners, providing shelter and veterinary care for animals in need, and finding loving homes for adoptable, homeless animals.
