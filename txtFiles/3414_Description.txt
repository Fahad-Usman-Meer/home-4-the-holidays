			<p>OC Animal Care is an open-admission animal shelter. As such, we took in more than 30,000 dogs, cats, bunnies and other pets last year. Some may be ill or injured. Others may have behavioral issues or be aggressive. We receive pets from people who can no longer care for them, and pets that are no longer wanted. We receive many perfectly healthy dogs and cats that just need a new home.</p>

			<p>We believe it is not the animal&rsquo;s fault for being at the shelter. We want every healthy, treatable and manageable animal to get a second chance at love. We are doing that in a variety of ways.</p>

			<p>OC Animal Care strives to save the lives of all healthy, treatable and manageable dogs and cats in our community. To reach that goal, we host monthly adoption events and promote our animals online. In addition, we work very closely with our non-profit rescue adoption partners, other local animal shelters and our volunteer foster caretakers. We are also fortunate to have the support of <a href="http://www.noblefriendsfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Noble Friends Foundation for OC Animal Care</a> who fundraises on our behalf.</p>
