<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><center><font face="Comic Sans MS">In 2007, we placed nearly 900 animals into loving homes</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> from our temporary facility. </font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Each one of these animals was given shelter, food, medical aid and vaccinations</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> and time to find the right home. </font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our doctors mended mutilated limbs and cured many illnesses </font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that these animals could get a second chance at good lives.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is our goal to have our own facility devoted to helping our homeless friends </font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that we can give many more animals a chance to find the homes they deserve. </font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it is our mission to educate the public about the problems of pets </font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over population and offer solutions for ending it.</font></center></pre>
