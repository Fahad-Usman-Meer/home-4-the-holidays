<p>CARE began in late 2003 in honor of Founder and President Tara Haltiwanger&rsquo;s beloved rescue dog, Cullen, who was shot and killed in 2001 during a home invasion. Cullen was himself a rescued Greyhound mix and the model for our logo. CARE officially acquired 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in 2005.</p>

<p>CARE educates the public on prevention of animal cruelty, proper care for animals according to species, animal behavior and training, heartworm disease and prevention, proper immunization, and the importance of spaying/neutering. CARE is an all-species rescue made up of volunteers with varied experience in veterinary medicine with companion animals (domestic and feral), exotic pets, small &amp; furry pets, and large &amp; farm animals.</p>

	CARE is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, no kill animal rescue group. We primarily hold events in and around Columbia, SC, but we have volunteers in SC, NC and GA. We do not limit ourselves to SC and work with other rescue groups in order to adopt out of state. We do not have a shelter. CARE has volunteers (foster parents) who care for the pets in their private homes. We are constantly in need of more volunteers and foster parents. If interested, please&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cullens.rescuegroups.org/info/contact">contact us</a>&nbsp;for more information. The animals need you more than you know!</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Please leave a message (email preferred). We are volunteers with careers, families (children and pets of our own, plus multiple foster pets). We will return your call or email as soon as possible.</em><br />
