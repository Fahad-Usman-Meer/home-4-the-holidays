<p>We foster unwanted Italian Greyhounds and locate new forever homes for them throughout the states of New York, New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania.&nbsp; We have rescue reps in most of the 50 states within the USA, so feel free to reach out to us to adopt or surrender a dog, or to make a holiday donation to help our foster dogs.</p>
