<p><strong>Southern Shih Tzu Rescue,&nbsp;</strong> (SSTR) is a 501(c)3 charity organization. &nbsp;ALL volunteer, &nbsp;small rescue organization, located in central Alabama.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have foster homes in AL, GA and PA areas. &nbsp;We focus on rescuing dogs from kill shelters and puppy mill survivors. &nbsp;We are NOT a public shelter, we do not take in lost or stray dogs and on rare occasions we may take an owner surrender, but only if we have NO dogs awaiting rescue at a local kill shetler.<br />
<br />
We also provide sanctuary care for senior and special needs furbabies, allowing them to live out their life in a loving home. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
SSTR takes in any toy breed regardless of age, health and/or temperament, <strong>when funding and foster room allows</strong>. Unfortunately, we are currently limited on funds and foster homes. Due to these limitations, we are forced to limit the number of babies we help.<br />
<br />
All dogs are placed in foster care for evaluation and vet-work, which includes: spay/neuter, vaccinations, heart worm test, deworm and treatment of all other medical issues, based on vet recommendation (heartworm treatment, dental work, hip surgery, eye surgery, liver shunt surgery, etc...)<br />
<br />
SSTR also participates in local animal welfare events, promoting the education of animal welfare, prevention of abuse/neglect, spay/neuter programs and encourage people to adopt shelter and rescue pets, reducing the number of animals killed in shelters.<br />
<br />
We look forward to a world where our relationship with animals is guided by compassion and seek a truly humane society in which animals are respected and where the human-animal bond is strong.</p>
