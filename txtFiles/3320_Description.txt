Every humane organization dreams of the day when cruelty to animals can be reduced to the point of elimination and the killing of homeless animals will have ended. The Poundhounds Adoption Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.) was formed to help bring this dream to reality. P.A.W.S. has two main goals as its purpose: education and opportunity. We hope to provide information that will lead to an awareness of the need for people to be responsible and kind stewards over animals. Our second goal is to provide opportunity for animals that deserve a second chance as well as the opportunity for willing volunteers to have a positive, fun and enriching experience with animal rescue. Those of us involved in P.A.W.S. believe that many people are unaware of the wonderful animals available through local shelters. People want to save lives. By providing education and opportunity, together we can make a difference!
