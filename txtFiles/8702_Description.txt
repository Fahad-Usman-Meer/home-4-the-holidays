<p><strong>WSKR is a run by a small group of volunteers scattered across the community. We are not operating out of a centralized shelter location, our foster volunteers open their homes to the kitties we rescue. This provides the kitties with as stable and home-like an environment as possible while they wait for their forever home to find them. We work closely with southern Arizona animal shelters to rescue cats and kittens who are at risk of suffering an unpleasant fate, we rehabilitate them and then work to help them find their forever homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
