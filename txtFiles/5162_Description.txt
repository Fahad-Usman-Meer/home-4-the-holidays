<p>Serving the greater Central Savannah River Area (CSRA), the CSRA Humane Society finds loving, permanent homes for pets whose guardians can no longer care for them. &nbsp;We sponsor a spay/neuter program for area pet guardians and also serve as a humane education resource for our community on responsible people-pet relationships and the humane treatment of all animals.</p>

<p>The IRS designates the CSRA Humane Society as a 501 (c)(3) non-profit privately-funded organization for tax purposes. &nbsp;We get no local, state, or federala tax dollars nor any money from the large national humane groups.</p>
