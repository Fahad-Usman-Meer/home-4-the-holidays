<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy Holidays. We are&nbsp; a local humane Society /SPCA&nbsp; saving lives of animals on death row with disabilities&nbsp; from our local NE Animal Care and Services.</font>&nbsp; Due to their disabilities, most of the animals are unadoptable because of their medical issues, but thru the help of our local Vets, we are able to&nbsp; give them the medical treatments they need , thus becoming adoptable.&nbsp; All of the animals up for adoption are beautiful in many specials ways. They need that new &quot;Leash on Life.&quot; We have many senior cats and dogs up for adoptions. They make wonderful family members. Please adopt and make a difference.our website is animalsinneedusa.org. 888-873-1897<br />
