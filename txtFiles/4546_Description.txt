<p align="left"><font face="comic sans MS"><font face="comic sans MS" size="3">Fur-Ever Family is a no-kill shelter. Our kitties' living area is a home-like environment with windows, cat-friendly furniture, and toys. Our cats and kittens are not caged, but are allowed to socialize so that we may evaluate their personalities-- assessing how they play, eat, even sleep.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="comic sans MS" size="3">We believe every cat or kitten has a unique personality and disposition.&nbsp;Fur-Ever Family matches each one to the temperment and lifestyle of its adoptive family. The goal is to place our kitties where they will thrive, as well as to provide you with a companion which fits well into your family. </font></p>
