<p>We're a &quot;small animal rescue specializing in rabbits&quot;.&nbsp; We've always done well working with bunnies but, with our Feline E-List Program, our cat adoptions have gone &quot;through the roof&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see around 500 abandoned bunnies each year.&nbsp; We find homes for 300+ each year, as well.&nbsp; However, in the past year, we have found homes for over <em>1000 cats and kittens !</em>&nbsp; We're sooo grateful for all the folks willing to adopt rather than purchase .. There are a lot more than you'd think.</p>
