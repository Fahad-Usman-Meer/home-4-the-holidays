Hundreds more have received food, grooming, medical attention and, when appropriate, transfer to other qualified rescue organizations that then place them in caring adoption programs.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="BodyCopy"><span style="COLOR: black"><font face="Arial" size="2">Our progressive foster-care program helps ensure successful adoptions. Because our rescued animals are fostered by families in safe and comfortable environments, they can be monitored and evaluated for both health and behavioral concerns. The animals become more prepared for life in their permanent homes as well.</font></span></p>
