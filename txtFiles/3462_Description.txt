Kitty City Kansas &amp; Puppy Town Rescue is a 501 C3 non-profit-all volunteer-no-kill rescue.&nbsp; We take underaged kittens and puppies from shelters that are full or do not have the capability of taking care of them.&nbsp; We take care of these animals in licensed foster homes until they are big enough to adopt.&nbsp;
