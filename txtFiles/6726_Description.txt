Crossroads Shih Tzu Rescue is a small 501(c)3 federal nonprofit rescue  dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing of Shih  		Tzu and Shih Tzu mixes who find themselves facing euthanasia in  		shelters, released from puppy mills and needing a new chance at life  and  		other dogs from unfortunate situations.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Our mission and goal are simple... to rescue as many needy Shih  Tzu and  		Shih Tzu mixes as our resources will allow, to rehabilitate them in  		preparation for their new families and lives, and to find the absolute   		best possible forever homes for them.<br />

<em>One by one... until there are none.        </em>
