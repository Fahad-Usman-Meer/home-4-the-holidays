<p>The STAR Project is a 501(c)3 organization based in Nebraska.&nbsp;Our Mission is to&nbsp;bring change to the lives of animals who are&nbsp;at risk for unnecessary euthanasia, have suffered abuse and neglect, deemed special needs, rapidly deteriorating in the shelter, or facing breed discrimination. The STAR Project will provide a home&nbsp;through our network of approved foster providers, as well as&nbsp;medical care and training&nbsp;until they find their forever home. We offer help and advocacy&nbsp;to animals nationwide, and support the humans who make it possible.&nbsp;</p>
