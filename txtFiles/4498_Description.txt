<h3>About Us&mdash;PAWS Mission Statement </h3>
<p>PAWS Adoption Center is a no-kill, non-profit animal shelter dedicated to providing care and shelter for unwanted dogs and cats and placing them in loving homes. Our mission is to reduce the number of homeless pets by promoting adoption, spay/neuter and responsible pet ownership. </p>
<h3>PAWS History </h3>
<p>Incorporated in 1980, The Progressive Animal Welfare Society, now better known as PAWS, was originally formed by a small group of concerned animal lovers. Its goal was to establish a dog and cat adoption center that did not utilize euthanasia. In addition to wanting to provide a no-kill alternative, PAWS' founder realized the importance of providing spay/neuter and medical treatment for all animals in their care.</p>
<p>Having established its goals, PAWS moved into an existing dog boarding kennel on its current property. A trailer was added to provide office space and housing for cats. In 1989 the trailer was replaced by expanding the original kennel, and since then all animals have been housed in the same building. PAWS has operated in this location for over 25 years, maintaining its original goals. </p>
