<p><font face="Arial"><font>CARA is a non profit &quot;no-kill&quot; animal rescue group located in Jackson, MS  that provides food, shelter &amp; care for hundreds of abused, unwanted,  &amp; stray animals. <br />
CARA is operated mainly by volunteers &amp; a few part-time  employees. The expenses for our programs &amp; services are supported by private  donations from individuals, businesses, &amp; fund raising events throughout the  year. We receive no funds from the city, county, state or federal government.<br />
The primary goal of CARA is the placement of our adoptable animals into loving,  caring homes; thereby enhancing the bond between animals &amp; people.  Our services are designed to promote responsible pet ownership.  By education, communities can learn the benefits of proper care &amp; treatment of  all pets &amp; why spay/neuter is important.</font></font></p>
