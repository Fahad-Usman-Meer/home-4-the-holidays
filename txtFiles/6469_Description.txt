Tails of Courage is a non-profit animal rescue organization committed  to rescuing dogs. We are entirely funded by donations and depend on  volunteers.&nbsp; Founded in 2009, the mission of the organization is to help  as much as possible with various programs within the communities we  serve.&nbsp; At present, Tails of Courage has Chapters in Connecticut, New  York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia with Florida, California and  Massachusetts coming soon!&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have various programs - Heroic Paws, Traveling Tails of Courage and Run Your Race, along with our&nbsp; animal rescue efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We DO have a kennel, and we also rely upon foster homes to house and  nurture our furry friends until a loving forever home is found. We are  always happy to answer any questions about adopting a new pet and will  gladly provide any support you may need throughout the adoption process.</p>
