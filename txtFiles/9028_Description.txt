<p><strong>COUNTRY CATS RESCUE, INC.&nbsp;is a small no-kill volunteer-run not-for-profit 501(c)3 which is a foster-based feline-only rescue group whose mission is to find permanent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.countrycatsrescue.com/About-Us.html#">homes</a>&nbsp;for our cats and kittens in the Fredericksburg area, Spotsylvania County, and surrounding areas in Virginia.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>We do not have a shelter and rely on a group of dedicated foster homes to care for our felines until a &quot;fur-ever&quot; home can be found.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>All of our cats and kittens are fully vetted, tested, vaccinated, and spayed or neutered. They come from area shelters, managed colonies, abandoned strays, and from people who can no longer care for them.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>We actively promote the education of spay/neuter, trap-neuter-return (TNR) for feral cats and best practices in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.countrycatsrescue.com/About-Us.html#">companion</a>&nbsp;animal care. &nbsp;</strong></p>
