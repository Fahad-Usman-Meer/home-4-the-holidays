<p class="MsoNormal">We are a nonprofit cat&nbsp; and dog rescue&nbsp;working primarily out of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Reading</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:state></st1:place> with some&nbsp;work being done in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Lancaster</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">PA</st1:state></st1:place> as well. We are made up of a group of volunteers that foster stray and unwanted kittens,cats, puppies and dogs &nbsp;until adoption. We do not have a shelter. We care for <span class="GramE">our fosters</span> in our home. They are not kept in cages but treated like members of our family so they can be loved and socialized properly. We are always in desperate need of good foster homes. If you love kitties or doggies and have a safe, caring environment, you may be the perfect foster mom or dad.&nbsp; &nbsp;All vet expenses are covered by our group, and we do try and provide food donations when we get them.
