We have an active adoption program for the homeless dogs and cats (and other domestic animals) that come under our care at the Caroline County Animal Shelter. We offer low cost spay neuter clinics and programs for pets belonging to Caroline County residents. We also provide humane education, assistance and other outreach programs to our community.</p>
