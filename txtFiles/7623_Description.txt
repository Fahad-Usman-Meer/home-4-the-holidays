We live in a very small (7,000) very remote town in No. Arizona &amp; border the Navajo Nation.&nbsp; We are an all volunteer non-profit organization that works with our City animal control who operate a holding facility for dogs &amp; cats 'at large'.&nbsp; It is only a holding facility.&nbsp; We help to feed &amp; clean all the animals in the City shelter 6 days a week in exchange for being able to rescue animals not claimed.&nbsp; We do adoptions off site &amp; at the shelter on Thursdays/Fridays &amp; Saturdays.&nbsp; We also go out of town to events, traveling 2 hours one way to the closet City (Flagstaff, AZ) All of our animals are spay/neutered &amp; vaccinate.&nbsp; We use foster care &amp; donations to operate &amp; take care of the animals we can. We are a young group, established in 2009.&nbsp; We also work with other organizations, 2nd Chance Center for Animals in Flagstaff, AZ and Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah to transport animals for in-take &amp; use their clinics as well as our local vet. You can view all of our adoptable animals on our Petfinder website.
