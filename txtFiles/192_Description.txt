<h3><font color="#00008b"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000"><u>HOW DOES THE ADOPTION PROCESS WORK?</u></font></font></font></h3>
<h3><font color="#00008b"><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">You are welcome to walk through our kennels during our normal business hours to view all our adoptable animals. If you see an animal you would like to visit with or would like to take the first step in the adoption process, applications are available in our front lobby. Before you have a private visit with any animal, an application and interview is required. Once you have gone through this process we keep the application on file for 6 months and you will be able to visit with any animal you are interested in during that time. <br />
