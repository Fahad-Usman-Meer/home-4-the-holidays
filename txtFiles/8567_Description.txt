Save a Dog a Day is a 501c (3) animal rescue group that is dedicated to saving animals from our shelters, having them vetted and getting them all the medical attention they may need. We place them in loving foster homes where they are loved until we find them their forever homes. We rescue from high kill shelters in NC and NY. We have many animals we rescue that are not healthy or are have special needs. They all need a chance at a good life. We have a puppy that we rescued that has 3 legs. He chewed his paw off after it became caught in an animal trap. Tres needs more surgery. We rescued another puppy that has neurological damage and is blind. We will find the perfect homes for them. We have the best group of volunteers who work round the clock for us and would do anything to save an animal. What a reward it is when we see our rescue animal go from the cage in the dark noisy&nbsp;shelter to the loving arms of their new family members. When we get pictures of them weeks, months and even years later it melts our hearts and it's easy to remember why we volunteer our time to help these animals. They deserve it!
