<p>The Jackson/Teton County Animal Shelter's mission is to provide humane care to, and find homes for, lost and abandoned companion animals; educate the public on responsible animal ownership; and enforce animal regulations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Every year at least seven hundred animals pass through the Shelter.&nbsp; On the average, 70% are returned to their owners, and the remaining 30% are adopted into new homes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Adoption fees are very reasonable.&nbsp; Donated funds cover the cost to spay/neuter and vaccinate adoptable animals.</p>
