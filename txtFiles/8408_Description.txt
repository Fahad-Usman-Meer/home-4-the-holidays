<p>Thank you for taking the time to view PAWS of Central Louisiana&#39;s (501c3) &quot;Home 4 The Holidays&quot; campaign.&nbsp;We are a community&nbsp;non-profit organization striving to save animals in our area, one life at a time. We depend on our donations and fundraising efforts to remove animals from the shelter where there is a high euthanazation&nbsp;rate, as well as promoting adoption, spay/neuter, and responsible ownership&nbsp;in the community.</p>

<p>Our primary goal is to rescue the animals on the kill list at the Pineville Animal Shelter in&nbsp;Pineville LA. We also take in surrenders, strays, and neglected animals from the central Louisiana community, rehabiltate them, vet them, and adopt them out to permanent loving homes. We hope to give as many animals as possible a wonderful home for Christmas.</p>
