*****We do not have a facility- we rely on foster homes to house animals in our program.  Please contact us to arrange to meet an animal you are interested in!*****

Caring about the world we live in...
Learning to discover and honor our individuality.....
Connecting with other species to promote ethological integrity....

Our mission is to create opportunities for emotional, spiritual, mental and physical health, growth or rehabilitation for animals and humans.

Our main goals are to: 
1.  Provide adoption or rescue options to homeless animals of Carbon County, and resources to people to help them keep their animals in the home.
2.  Assist other rescues and shelters in rehabilitating animals that are harder to adopt because of behavioral challenges through education, behavioral modification programs, and support to adopters/foster families of animals in the program.
