<p>Alberta (AB) Herding Dog Rescue is a small registered not-for-profit group that takes in, cares for &amp; works with herding breeds. We foster primarily Border Collies, Australian Cattle Dogs, German Shepherds, Australian Kelpies, Australian Shepherds and Belgian Sherpherds (Tervurens, Malinois, Groendals) but other herding breeds or crosses that display similar, misunderstood herding behaviors are also considered.</p>

<p>These dogs, although often high drive or high intensity, must be good candidates for adoption by the general public - dog or people aggressive dogs are not considered.&nbsp; Our goal is to find pet homes for those that don&#39;t herd, working homes for those that do &amp; generally active homes that will give the breeds what they need.</p>
