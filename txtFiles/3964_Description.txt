The Animal Welfare Society has been serving the Howard County, Maryland community for over 50 years.

We offer low-cost sterilizations and vaccinations to help reduce pet overpopulation and the incidence of disease. We are also a rescue organization for companion animals. Most often, we rescue pets from overcrowded high-kill Baltimore shelters.

This non-profit facility receives no government funding. Your donations to our shelter will assist us in continuing to provide these services to the community. We hope that you will patronize our services and refer us to other pet owners. In this way, we can continue our mission of helping people to help their pets live longer, healthier lives!
