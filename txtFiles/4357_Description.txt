We are a nonprofit, charitable animal welfare organization that works to  end the euthanasia of healthy, adoptable animals in Bulloch County &amp; often surrounding counties.<br />
*We are NOT the Bulloch County Animal Shelter.*<br />
<br />
We depend on our active volunteers and foster homes to help us take in as many pets as we can. <br />

Our Mission:<br />
To end the euthanasia of healthy, adoptable animals in Bulloch County.&nbsp;
