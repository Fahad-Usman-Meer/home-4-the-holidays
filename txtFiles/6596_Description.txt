Pups Rescue is an organization that became a non-profit in 2005. We have rescued and found home for over 4000 puppies. We mainly rescue puppies, but there is an occasional adult dog, cat and kittens that we have started rescuing. Since 2005, we have taken in about 80 pregnant dogs to allow them to have their pups in the comfort of a home instead of the pound. This is a home based organization with only one foster home. It is mainly run by one person, Marilyn Williams, who takes in the pups, gets their health to where it should be, takes care of vaccines and alterations and finds them homes.
