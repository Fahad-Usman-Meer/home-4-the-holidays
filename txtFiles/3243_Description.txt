<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Woodford Humane Society, established in 1975, is a private, non-profit animal center that services all of central Kentucky. Our open door policy means we accept ALL animals, regardless of health, breed, age or temperament. We provide shelter and care for owner-surrendered and stray animals and strive to find good, loving homes for each of them. A careful screening process helps us match the right animals to the right homes. We are proud to be part of a nationwide campaign called &ldquo;No More Homeless Pets&rdquo; and strive for this goal through S.A.V.E. which stands for Spay/neuter, Adopt, Volunteer, and Educate.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">With no government funding, we are completely dependent on private contributions to continue to provide care to over one thousand animals each year. In 2006, the Woodford Humane Society placed 90% of our animals! The national average for group like ours stands around 25%. Over 50% of our animals come from surrounding counties and 65% find homes outside of Woodford County.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so support is tax deductible. To learn more about our adoptable animals, programs, or events, please visit www.woodfordhumanesociety.org.</span></font></p>
