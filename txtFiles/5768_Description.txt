<p><strong>The Lost Dogs' Home</strong></p>
<p><strong>Compassion and care for unwanted dogs and cats since 1910</strong></p>
<p>The Lost Dogs' Home has been providing care for lost, stray, injured and abandoned cats and dogs since 1910. This legacy of compassion continues today through services and programs that improve the welfare of unwanted animals. The Lost Dogs' Home plays a crucial role in the promotion of Responsible Pet Ownership programs and is a strong lobbyist for legislation that will decrease the number of abandoned and stray animals being admitted to animal pounds and shelters in the community. The Home helps fight for fairer standards for those without a voice.</p>
<p>The Lost Dogs' Home is Australia's largest animal shelter with facilities in both Victoria and New South Wales. The Home rescues and cares for over 21,000 cats and dogs every year.</p>
<p>One of the Home's most important services is the Adoption Program. All dogs and cats for adoption are health checked, temperament tested, desexed, vaccinated, microchipped and come with a National Pet Register collar tag. Dogs also come with a free obedience lesson. Dogs and cats needing a new home can be viewed on The Lost Dogs' Home website.</p>
