<p>Rainbow Animal Rescue is a small foster-based canine rescue. &nbsp;We typically pull those dogs who have very little chance of getting out either because of health problems or age or both. &nbsp;Most other rescues don&#39;t want to pull them because they are expensive to treat and take longer to find homes. &nbsp;They deserve the same chance that the cute, fluffy dogs get. &nbsp;We are all volunteer and rely solely on donations.</p>
