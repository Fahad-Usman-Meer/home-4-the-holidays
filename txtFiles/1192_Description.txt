<p>We are a municipally run shelter servicing four cities.&nbsp; Our space is very limited, but we do our very best to get animals adopted into loving, secure homes.&nbsp; We also have a website&nbsp;listing at <font face="sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.metro.petfinder.com">www.metro.petfinder.com</a></font> of currently available pets.&nbsp; Things can (and do) change daily here so stop in to see if your next fur-kid is here!&nbsp; </p>
<p>All of our pets are spayed and neutered upon adoption or, if too young, scheduled for such with a local participating veterinarian.&nbsp; We also microchip adopted pets to ensure their return home if they happen to wander.&nbsp; All pets recieve their first vaccine and cats are also tested for FELV/FIV!&nbsp; That's alot for only $75.&nbsp; If you have room in your home to adopt a lifelong friend during the holiday season, (or any other time) come visit our shelter - We may have what you've been searching for!&nbsp; We would love to exceed last year's total adoptions and need your help!&nbsp; Thank you - and Happy Holidays!</p>
