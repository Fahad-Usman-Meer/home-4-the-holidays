<p>On May 29th, 2015 Oasis closed on a 21 acre farm property in Franklinville, NJ, which we are transforming into a peaceful and healing environment for some of southern New Jersey&rsquo;s abused and abandoned animals - a refuge to heal spirits and prepare them for a new life, as well as a permanent home for those too traumatized for re-homing.</p>

<p>With boundless gratitude to all the supporters who have followed us throughout our 14 years, we want to acknowledge that this purchase was also made possible through generous inheritances from The Helen Heck Estate and The Harriet Doolittle Estate.&nbsp; May these two lovely women rest in peace knowing their love of animals lives on in a grand way through their donations to Oasis.</p>

<p><em>&nbsp;The large home on the property will contain the caretaker&rsquo;s residence, an administrative area, a room for mommas and their brand new babies, and a home for our &ldquo;pocket pets&rdquo; &ndash; hamsters, gerbils, birds, ferrets, etc.&nbsp; The large garage will be converted to &ldquo;Doolittle&rsquo;s Dog House&rdquo; in honor of Dr. Harriet Doolittle, one of our founding Trustees and devoted dog lover.&nbsp; Each dog will have its own &ldquo;suite&rdquo;, and a shared yard in which to exercise and play.&nbsp; The cottage on the property needs a major overhaul and will become a &ldquo;Heck of a Cat House&rdquo; ,&nbsp; in honor of Helen Heck, a private donor to Oasis who loved felines.&nbsp; A bright and airy cottage in which they can freely roam (no cages), with various levels and lots of cubbies to help the cats socialize&nbsp; new home</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;so they are more adoptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lovely property is home to some fruit trees, a secluded pond complete with fish and frogs, and a &frac12; mile track upon which we can exercise the horses and the dogs.&nbsp; The large fenced horse pastures (some complete with run-in shelters) allow the equines and other farm animals&nbsp;to graze in peace and run at will.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Our new address is 698 Central Avenue, Franklinville, NJ&nbsp; 08322.&nbsp; We hope you will be able to come visit our new home and see the potential this lovely farm has to offer the animals.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is truly a sanctuary in every sense of the word.</p>
