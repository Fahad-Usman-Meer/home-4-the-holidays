<p><font size="2"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Greyhounds passing through our kennel have gentle dispositions and make wonderful companions. Since its inception in 1983, Greyhound Friends has found homes for more than 6000 dogs! We maintain a kennel for twenty greyhounds and as soon as a dog is adopted another one comes in from a racing kennel. Dogs who come to us are groomed, treated medically, fed and cared for as time permits. Most respond immediately to kind treatment and are readied for adoption in just a few days. Greyhound Friends relies on our volunteers who help with all aspects of the work. You can also support Greyhound Friends by becoming a member and volunteering.</span><br style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana" />
