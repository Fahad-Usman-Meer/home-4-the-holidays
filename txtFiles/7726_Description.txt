<p><strong>We are a small Non-Profit No Kill shelter in Cape May Court House NJ, we run on donations only.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We have enough kennels for 10 dogs and approximately 50 cats.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We run on volunteers only and our mission is to place all of our pets into loving forever homes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is a seasonal community and we provide a food bank to help families feed their pets so that they wouldn&#39;t have to give them up.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As of August we adopted out 30 dogs leaving 11 dog to adopt out and as of 12-24-2013 we only had 5 left in our kennel. (Four are are Pitt Bulls which needs special homes.)</strong></p>
