Andrews Rescue &amp; Foster Care celebrates the small breed dog!&nbsp; We are strictly a small breed dog rescue and foster care and we find our dogs at shelters all over West TX.&nbsp; It's really a privilege to be able to provide quality dogs to our forever families.&nbsp; We are a non profit organization and we love doing what we do.&nbsp; This is our passion and we are hoping to find the right forever family for every dog we have!
