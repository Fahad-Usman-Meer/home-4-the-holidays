<h3>FOR THE HOPE IN ALL OF US!</h3>
<p>For Hope, Inc. is a rescue and support group committed to helping families get vaccinations, medical attention, medications, spay and nueters for thier dogs. We belive that keeping a loved dog in a home is the best for both dog and people. We also take in and foster dogs that are injured, ill, abused or are the &quot;Throw Aways&quot;. We give these special dogs time to heal thier bodies, souls, minds and hearts. We then work hard to find them that special forever home where they will never again be hurt or in danger.</p>
