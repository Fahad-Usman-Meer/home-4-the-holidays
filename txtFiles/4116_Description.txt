Forever Friends is a group of people who have been fostering with other organizations for many years.&nbsp; We have come together to find &quot;forever homes&quot; for animals who are abandoned, or can no longer be kept by their owners.&nbsp; We spay/neuter all animals before adoption, they are up to date on shots, check for heartworm (dogs) and leukemia/HIV (cats), wormed and treated for fleas.
