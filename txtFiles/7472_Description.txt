Rockwall Pets is a Texas-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation formed by dedicated animal rescue volunteers. We use innovative programs to get pets out of shelters alive. Statistics prove there are more than enough homes for all homeless pets. We believe that by convincing more people to adopt instead of buying their next dog or cat, we can save the lives of pets who are currently being put down in area shelters.

Nearly every pet we have available for adoption is a healthy or treatable pet who was at risk of being killed at a shelter.

Our ultimate goal is to help make Texas one of the first No Kill states in America.
