<p>~Our Mission&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
With respect and compassion for all animal life, MEOW promotes lifelong relationships between people and<br />
companion animals, providing shelter and care for each precious life until adopted into a forever home.</p>

<p>~Our Vision&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
MEOW envisions a day when society will be free from the dangers and nuisances of irresponsible pet ownership, when every pet born will be assured loving care all of its natural life and will never suffer due to abuse, neglect or ignorance.</p>

<p>~Our History&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
In the early 1990s, a small group of animal-loving friends made a commitment to create a better life for homeless animals. With little more than determination, they started Mercer Island Eastside Orphans &amp; Waifs, now commonly called MEOW Cat Rescue &amp; Adoption, a non-profit organization with a no- holds-barred no-kill philosophy. MEOW is still staffed almost entirely by volunteers. It&rsquo;s still all about the animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>~Our Goal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
MEOW&rsquo;s goal is to help create a &ldquo;no-kill nation&rdquo;, where people are responsible for their pets, where there are no helpless creatures abandoned in boxes or left to fend for themselves in parking lots, where there is no longer a need for any healthy companion animal to be euthanized. Certainly, progress is being made. But there is so very far to go.</p>

<p>~Today&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
MEOW places approximately 1000 animals into permanent homes each year. Adoption fees from $65 to $95 help defray the cost of care for the animals. Donations from interested individuals, organizations and business provide additional financial support. Our application process ensures that every adopted animal is placed in an environment where there is appropriate space, human contact, and a commitment to safeguard and care for the animal for its entire lifetime. Our standards are high. The welfare of the animals is paramount in the placement process.<br />
Cats and kittens come from various sources and situations: orphans found under a deck, a stray or abandoned cat crying at the door, someone has developed allergies or is moving to a place where the cats are not welcome. Some come from the rescue community, finding tame cats and kittens feeding with feral colonies. Newborn or senior, healthy, ill or injured, all are valued at MEOW. Incoming cats and kittens are examined for general health, illness, injury, parasites and tested for feline viral diseases and provided appropriate medical care.&nbsp; Daily care of cats and kittens is done both in the shelter and in the foster homes of volunteers, sometimes involving bottle-feeding orphans, often requiring intensive medical care of ill animals.&nbsp; MEOW provides a safe haven and socialization as well as proper nutrition and a clean environment while the animals await adoptive homes.&nbsp; Our volunteers speak with the public, interview prospective adopters, and provide education concerning the care of pets on such subjects as spaying/neutering, introducing a new pet into the family, addressing behavioral issues, proper daily care and well-cat/kitten care.<br />
Each year MEOW is faced with the impossible and each and every day we recommit ourselves to something we truly believe in, the motto we adopted at our inception, &rdquo;all nine lives are precious&rdquo;.</p>
