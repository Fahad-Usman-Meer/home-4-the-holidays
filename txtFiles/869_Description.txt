Silver Dragon Pets is a foster-based no-kill pet rescue.&nbsp; We mostly work with dogs, but have also had the pleasure of working with cats, fish, birds, mice, rats, chinchillas, turtles, and a guinea pig.&nbsp; All of the animals are kept in foster care as a member of a family until a permanent home is found.&nbsp; We make sure all veterinary care is done prior to adoption, including spay/neuter, heartworm testing, microchipping, and vaccinations.&nbsp; We're known for taking in special needs pets, particularly those that would not stand a chance in a standard shelter setting.<br />
<br />
As a result, we need to do a lot of fundraising.&nbsp; We've opened our own <a href="http://SilverDragonRescue.etsy.com">shop</a> to help support the ever rising veterinary bills.
