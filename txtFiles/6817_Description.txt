<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>

<p>The Tennessee Humane Animal League is a 501(c)3 organization devoted to the placement of homeless or surrendered animals through The Pet Placement Center (PPC). The PPC survives entirely on donations and fundraising activities. We are the oldest no-kill animal adoption center in Hamilton County. The PPC is a private adoption center and does not contract with the city or county for animal services. Once an animal comes to the Pet Placement Center they will remain safe with us until (s)he is adopted into a responsible permanent home</p>

<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>

<p>To reduce animal suffering by promoting intelligent animal care through education and example.</p>

<p>To find responsible homes for lost or abandoned animals or for those pets whose owners can no longer keep them.</p>

<p>To promote spaying or neutering of dogs and cats in order to reduce and control the millions of unnecessary and unwanted animal births.</p>

<p>To emphasize responsible guardianship which includes proper and decent feeding, available water, shelter, necessary shots and exercise.</p>
