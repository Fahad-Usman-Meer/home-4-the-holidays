Austin Pets Alive! is promoting and proving the resources, education and programs needed to eliminate   the killing of companion animals in Austin.<br />
<br />
<p>Our top goal for 2008 is to create the Austin Pets Alive!   Animal Resource Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;facility will have five objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use innovative, efficient,   life-focused programs to attain No-Kill Success.  </li>
    <li>Relieve some of the burden on the city shelter by deflecting animals from TLAC to APA!</li>
    <li>Be the first resort rather than the last resort for pet owners&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;proactively affect the pet/pet owner relationships before it is too late. </li>
    <li>Be a role model for communities that are   interested in saving the lives that are traditionally killed. </li>
    <li>Engage the community.&nbsp; We want to help people help others and themselves   with pet problems.</li>
</ul>
