<p>Cabarrus Pets Society is a non-profit (501(c)3), all-volunteer run, all breed rescue for dogs and cats based in Cabarrus County, North Carolina.&nbsp; We serve Cabarrus and surrounding counties.&nbsp; We strive to help abandoned pets find loving homes and to educate the public to reduce the pet overpopulation problem until there are no needy animals left.<br />
<br />
At the moment we have no permanent, physical shelter to house our animals.&nbsp; They all stay in <a href="http://www.cabarruspets.com/fosterhomes.cfm">foster homes</a> until the perfect family comes along to give them the forever home each one of our animals needs and deserves.&nbsp; Our foster parents provide food, shelter, love, and often some training to get each pet ready for life with his or her new family.&nbsp; We are always in need of more foster homes to save more animals, so let us know if you&#39;re interested in learning more about this great opportunity to share your love and save a life!</p>
