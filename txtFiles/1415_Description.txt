<p>German Shepherd Rescue of Orange County (GSROC) is a non-profit 501c(3) charity organization dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating and re-homing purebred German Shepherd Dogs that have no where else to turn. We are an all volunteer organization with no paid staff. We are funded entirely by private donations and receive no government support. Dogs for adoption are housed in foster home situations and in private boarding facilities.</p>

<p><br />
Approximately 50% of the dogs that we rescue come to us directly from owners who are no longer able to care for them for one reason or another. The number one reason that we receive dogs is &ldquo;Moving&rdquo;, with the number two reason of &ldquo;No time for&rdquo; is a close second. Dogs also come to us when owners become ill or hospitalized, when owners pass away, when families lose their homes or lifestyles change. The other 50% of the dogs in our care are plucked from public animal shelters throughout Southern California when no owner comes to claim them or when they are no longer wanted. We race to save as many of these dogs into our care as we can, however limited space and resources constantly make our task difficult.</p>
