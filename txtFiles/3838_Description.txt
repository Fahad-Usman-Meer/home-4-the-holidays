            <div style="FONT-SIZE: 1.5em">Since 1903, Bideawee has been dedicated to a simple mission: to shelter and care for homeless cats and dogs until they can be adopted. Bideawee -- the name comes from a Scottish phrase for &quot;stay a while&quot; -- is one of the nation's oldest and most respected humane organizations.
