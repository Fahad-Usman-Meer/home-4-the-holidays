<p>Nebraska Border Collie Rescue is a non profit organization run entirely by volunteers. We take in dogs that are in danger of being euth.&nbsp; All dogs are spayed/neutered, inoculated, wormed, tested for hw and microchipped. They are then placed in a foster home where they stay until adopted. </p>
