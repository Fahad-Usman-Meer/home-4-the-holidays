S.H.A.I.D., which stands for &quot;Sheltering Helpless Animals in Distress&quot;, is located in Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Our doors have been open since 1986, and in 1990, we moved into our current building. This new shelter cost $120 000 and all the money was raised through fundraisers and donations. Our shelter was paid in full in 1995 and now all the money raised through our many fundraisers goes towards the care of our very important residents. We are a &quot;no kill&quot; shelter and therefor our residents do not have a time limit. We hope that this campaign will help some of our long time resident cats find their forever homes.
