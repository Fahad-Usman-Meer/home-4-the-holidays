<span id="ctl00_maincontent_lblShelterDescription"><strong><font size="4">In the late 60&rsquo;s a group of animal lovers joined&nbsp; together to try and improve conditions for forgotten animals&nbsp; roaming the area. In 1972, this group of people became the Taylor Jones&nbsp; Humane Society and was incorporated later that year. We are a&nbsp; non-profit, tax-exempt corporation managed by a group of unpaid volunteers. Our agency receives no government funding.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></strong><br />
<br />
<font size="4"><strong>In 1994, we were able for the first time to house all&nbsp; our animals under one roof. We began leasing runs and cages for our animals from&nbsp; Companion Vet Care and we were able to rest easy knowing they were receiving the&nbsp; loving care they deserved.&nbsp; </strong></font><br />
<br />
<font size="4"><strong>We emphasize our low cost spay/neuter&nbsp; programs. Educating the public about the problems of pet overpopulation&nbsp; and the benefits of owning neutered animals has become a very rewarding&nbsp; part of our work. We have gone into several area schools explaining how&nbsp; this affects&nbsp;each of us.<br />
<br />
We&nbsp;have now&nbsp;added&nbsp;another new chapter&nbsp;to our history. We have purchased a building to house our expanded operations. We&nbsp;have been able to provide a caring home for even more healthy, adoptable animals! Now we look to the future - more kennels, more adoptions,&nbsp;and more lives saved!<br />
