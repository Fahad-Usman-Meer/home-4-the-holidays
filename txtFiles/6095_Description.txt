<font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connecticut Greyhound Adoption - GPA is a non-profit, volunteer organization whose mission is to find permanent, loving homes for retired racing greyhounds.&nbsp; To fulfill this mission, our goals are threefold: to inform and educate the public about the joys of greyhound adoption; to identify suitable, caring homes for retired racers; and, to provide pre- and post-adoption support to facilitate the transition from track to home.&nbsp; CGA endeavors to work cooperatively with the greyhound racing industry to help as many greyhounds as possible, including special needs dogs.<br />
