</font></strong><font color="#000066">Mile High Weimaraner Rescue (MHWR) is an organization operated soley by volunteers dedicated to the welfare of the Weimaraner breed. MHWR is a rescue group who operates on donations and the support of the Weimaraner Foundation Fund - Rescue Committee, which is part of the Weimaraner Club of America. When a Weimaraner is placed in a new home an adoption fee is required in order to help with the expenses of rehoming Weimaraners. Expenses incurred by rescue include: spaying, neutering, vaccinations, veterinary care, microchips, and heartworm testing. Expenses incurred locally by rescue include: advertising, collars, leashes, tags, crates, dog beds, books, administrative expenses, etc. <br />
<br />
MHWR is located in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. We will only adopt a Weimaraner to those living within the following states: Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, Utah and South Dakota. If you wish to adopt a Weim from our rescue group, you will need to travel to the location of the dog please. We mostly operate out of Denver, CO, however we have branches in Wichita, KS and Rapid City, SD. <br />
<br />
We do not have a facility to house the Weimaraners that are available for adoption. Available Weimaraners are kept in their own home, in a foster home, in a boarding kennel, or in a shelter until they can find their new home.</font>
