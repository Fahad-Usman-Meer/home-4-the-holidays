<p>F.A.T. KATZ is an all-volunteer, no-kill,&nbsp;foster-based cat rescue group in Albuquerque dedicated exclusively to enhancing the lives of cats and kittens.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All cats in our program are cared for in temporary foster homes until they are adopted.&nbsp; Cats are first tested for Feline Leukemia and Feline Immunodeficiency&nbsp;Virus (FIV) to ensure they are negative prior&nbsp;to placing them in foster homes.&nbsp;Cats are also vaccinated and spayed or&nbsp;neutered prior to adoption.​<br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:1.6em">Countless innocent cats and kittens end&nbsp;up abandoned, hungry and homeless.&nbsp;Sometimes injured or abused. &nbsp;F.A.T. KATZ seeks to help these cats by taking them into our foster program, giving them love, medical attention and finding them loving,&nbsp;permanent homes of their very own.​</span><br />
