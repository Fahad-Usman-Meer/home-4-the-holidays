<p>Pit Bulls do face breed racism. It's a sad fact. Some people have a closed mind and can't be reached. Other simply have the wrong perception of the breed and those minds we can change! A well behaved Pit Bull walking quietly on a leash or playing gently with a child can send a powerful message to people. The media seems to focus on the negative and not the positive. Have Pit Bulls attacked people? Yes. But so have many other breeds that aren't considered dangerous, so those cases don't get the media attention. I believe there are no bad dogs, just bad owners. Personally, I would like to see more attention put on the how people abuse the breed by forcing them to fight.&nbsp;Shed some light on the cruelty that these dogs have to endure for the entertainment of some disturbed people. </p>
<p>We currently are very limited on our space. We are only able to rescue the Pit Bulls in the most dire of need. One day, we hope we won't have to turn away any Pit in need. </p>
<p>The bullies don't have a voice, but we do. We will sing their praise and seek to end the racism that haunts the breed.</p>
