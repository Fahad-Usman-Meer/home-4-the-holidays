By working with  committed volunteers, foster homes, local veterinarians, trainers, and  boarding facilities, we are able to rescue hundreds of animals every  year, provide them with loving temporary care, and find them  well-matched, carefully screened forever homes. We also serve as a  resource to our community and all pet owners by providing education and  information on responsible pet ownership, including the importance of  spay/neuter, positive behavior training, and good nutrition.</font>
