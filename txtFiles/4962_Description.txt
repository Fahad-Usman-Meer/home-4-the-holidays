<p>Pawsitively Precious Adoptions is a very small non-profit rescue group created to assist homeless cats and kittens in the Williamsburg area. We provide local TNR (Trap/Neuter/Return) services for feral cats, and try to find homes for the tame or abandoned cats rescued from our TNR sites. Our purpose is to humanely, compassionately, and non-lethally control cat overpopulation by spaying and neutering. We do not have a freestanding shelter, but many of our adoptable cats can be seen at the cat Adoption Centers at the Petsmart&nbsp;in Wiliamsburg; while others may be in foster care.</p>
