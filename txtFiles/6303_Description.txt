We are dedicated to saving homeless, unwanted and abandoned cats. We depend solely on donations, which are tax deductible.</p>

<p>NAR focuses on having feral (wild) cats spayed and/or neutered to decrease overpopulation. In the process of helping feral cats, we come across many who are friendly. These cats receive medical attention with the help of local veterinarians, and when ready, are put up for adoption. All our cats are cared for in foster homes. As a general policy, we do not take owner-surrendered cats.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to place all cats in stable, loving homes where they will be cared for and never be abandoned, abused or neglected.</p>
