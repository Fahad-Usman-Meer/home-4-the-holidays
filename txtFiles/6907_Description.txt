<font size="4" face="Verdana">The Hancock County Animal Shelter serves Hancock County, Kentucky. We are a relatively new shelter which opened in 2010. Before then, adoptions of dogs throughout the community were unheard of. We are proud to say our adoption rate has soared and we are making a difference in this rural county. We work with wonderful, reputable rescue groups and our volunteers cannot be beat! Our dogs go to some wonderful homes, and we love getting the stories, pictures&nbsp;and feedback from their new families.</font>
