<font face="Arial">The Marion County Humane Society is open on Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays from 10am until 4pm.&nbsp; The Mission of the Marion County Humane Society is to humanely care for homeless pets, return them to their current owners, or adopt them to new loving homes.&nbsp; In addition we will educate the public about responsible pet ownership and the importance of spaying and neutering their pets The Marion County Humane Society was founded in November 1986 by a group of caring volunteers.&nbsp;&nbsp; After an agreement was made with the city, they began operating out of the former city dog pound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the years they have returned lost pets to their owners, added on to the old facility, educated the public of the importance of spaying and neutering and seen a major decline in the number of abandoned pets come into the shelter.&nbsp; The volunteers have placed over 5000 unwanted dogs and cats from the Knoxville and surrounding areas. In October 2000 the volunteers made a decision to close the MCHS because the facility had detireoted beyond repair.&nbsp; In June 2008 after raising over $230,000.00 the Marion County Humane Society opened the doors of their new facility.</font>
