<p>Circle Tail is an Assistance Dog International (ADI) accredited organization that provides service and hearing dogs to people with disabilities at no charge to the individual, and strengthens the human-canine bond in the community through our dog adoption program, educational programs, and&nbsp;obedience training.<br />
<br />
Careful selection of puppies and adult dogs from breeder donations, unwanted litters, family releases, and area shelters and rescues not only helps people with disabilities, but also provides purpose to an otherwise unwanted dog&#39;s life.</p>
