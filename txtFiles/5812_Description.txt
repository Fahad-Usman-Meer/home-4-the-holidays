The thrift shop resells household goods&nbsp;to the public to help with some of the costs associated with dog rescue. We are very integrated in our community; and responsible&nbsp;dog ownership is our passion. The euthanasia rate in Walton County is over 85%, and there is no humane society.&nbsp;All Petzone Dogs come from animal control facilities; and are saved before euthanasia. We have set up our facility like a doggie daycare, but just for our rescue dogs! They sleep in crate's at night, then play with their doggie friends during the day either in the large yard, or in the playroom where it's safe from the elements! We also work on manners, and obedience. All our dogs are temperament tested, dog friendly, crate trained and come with 4 free training lessons! We welcome new ideas, community service programs&nbsp;and volunteers. Please donate, sponsor a dog, shop or take advantage of our great services so we can save as many dogs as possible. Many thanks to all that continue to help us help dogs!</font><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(28, 28, 28);"><strong><br />
