<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The Animal Welfare Foster Program is a 501(c)3 non-profit animal rescue run by volunteer veterinary and pre-veterinary students in Blacksburg, Virginia. We coordinate and provide foster homes for animals until they are adopted into loving, permanent homes. During this time, they receive the appropriate healthcare (both routine preventative care and care for any medical conditions) and learn house manners so that they will become healthy, happy pets. </font></p>
