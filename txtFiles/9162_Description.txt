<p>Founded in 2008, by Whitney Knowlton, Last Chance Animal Rescue is a volunteer based nonprofit and our focus is to rescue animals located in &quot;KILL&quot; facilities trapped on death row in rural shelters still using inhumane methods of killing such as gas chambers or heart stick. &nbsp; Millions of pets are unnecessarily euthanized each year in the United States. LCAR is working to change the way shelter treat these precious animals so that this senseless loss can one day end.<br />
<br />
A majority of these animals are highly adoptable and die each day because of legislation deficits, lack of resources and limited chance of local adoption. We rescue regardless of age, breed or general health, and simply try to save as many as we can from death. We underwrite the cost of relocating them to &quot;NO KILL&quot; facilities and foster homes in hopes of finding them the forever family that they deserve. We network with other rescue organizations to transfer animals from our shelter partners into their adoption programs increasing the lives saved while expanding the potential for adoption. It is our mission to educate shelters on reform and to assist them on becoming &ldquo;NO KILL&rdquo; regardless of current legislation. Over the past six years LCAR has rescued thousands of animals and is growing everyday thanks to the support of our <a href="http://lcarescue.rescuegroups.org/info/display?PageID=12457">volunteers</a>, <em><a href="http://lcarescue.rescuegroups.org/info/display?PageID=12754">fosters</a>, <a href="http://lcarescue.rescuegroups.org/info/adoption">adopters</a>, <a href="http://lcarescue.rescuegroups.org/info/donate">donors </a>and <a href="http://lcarescue.rescuegroups.org/info/display?PageID=13662">sponsors</a>. &nbsp;</em> <em> Last Chance Animal Rescue&rsquo;s mission is to save the lives of loving deserving animals,&nbsp; and create long-term relationships between people and animals. </em></p>

<p>If this looks like a great way to spend your Saturday or Sunday we need your help, starting this weekend please join us to volunteer at adoption events across Long Island. &nbsp;We have 35 new arrivals heading to NY on Saturday and need helping hands to greet them and assist with the events during the day. &nbsp; <strong>ANY TIME you can share is so appreciated!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Please come out, help animals off the van, water, walk and feed them after their long journey from SC and help us get ready for the new day. Transport is from 8:30-11am depending on location and then we always need people to care for a specific dog during the event since leashed animals require a buddy for the day, someone to hang with and get to know. The events last till 3:30 when we begin to breakdown and fosters arrive for the animals. We are busiest during transport arrival and breakdown at the end of the day. <strong>Children under 16 need a parent to accompany them and we offer community service credits for volunteering. </strong> Please if you can help, reply to this message or <a href="mailto:info@lcarescue.org">email info@lcarescue.org</a> with any questions.&nbsp;</p>
