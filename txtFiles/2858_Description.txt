<p>Love For Paws Rescue <br />
is a&nbsp; nonprofit, 501(c)3 charitable organization. <br />
<br />
We are a non-specific breed or species rescue providing help to all animals in need.<br />
<br />
Because we are not a shelter, but a home based rescue, we are able to provide a loving home environment where we can rehabilitate and teach our rescues social skills that will help prepair them for thier &quot;Forever Homes&quot;</p>
<p>We are dedicated to reducing the numbers of unwanted animals through rescue, rehabilitation, responsible re-homing, and through public and community education, training and promoting of humane and responsible care for all animals</p>
