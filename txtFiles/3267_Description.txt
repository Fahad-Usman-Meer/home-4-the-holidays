<p>Camp Companion is an all-volunteer, all-foster home&nbsp;program.&nbsp; We build our success on trap neuter return (TNR).&nbsp; We have a very active adoption and foster program to find homes for the kittens and adults that are not feral and deserve a warm home of their own. &nbsp;We are also excited that our program has been helping more and more puppies and dogs in the last couple of years. &nbsp;This has brought many new volunteers and foster homes to our program giving loving care to our animals until they find their forever families.</p>
