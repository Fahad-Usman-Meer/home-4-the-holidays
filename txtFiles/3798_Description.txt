<strong><img src="http://erieshoreshumanesociety.com/Pictures/ESlogomain.gif" alt="" />Erie Shores Humane Society</strong> is an all-volunteer, grass-roots, non-profit animal welfare          organization. We follow the humane no-kill philosophy and are dedicated to the present and future well-being          of all animals. We have a network of foster homes that house our rescued animals, and as such are always in need of more volunteers who can welcome a furry friend in need into their homes! Please contact us at fureverhome@erieshoreshumanesociety.com for more information on how to volunteer with us.
