<p>Adopt-A-Pet is a no-kill orphanage and adoption service located in Victoria, Texas. We care for over one hundred animals every day. Our purpose is to <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">rescue, rehabilitate and find loving homes</span> for homeless animals. &nbsp; A low-cost spay/neuter program is also available as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce the number of unwanted puppies and kittens that are born.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adopt-A-Pet is a <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">non-profit, tax-deductible</span> community service organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopt-A-Pet <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">does not euthanize </span><span>animals to make room for others, so an </span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">active adoption program is very important.</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>For each animal we adopt, one more can be rescued.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Most of our animals come from the Victoria City/County Animal Shelter although some are strays or owner released animals.&nbsp; All our pets pass a strict health check including vaccinations, deworming, and spaying or neutering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Dogs</span></strong><span> are spay/neutered before being adopted and each dog is given a topical flea prevention. They are microchipped, dewormed and receive their two booster shots. Their rabies vaccine is also given. All dogs are tested for heartworms and are started on a monthly heartworm preventative program.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cats</span></strong><span> are also spayed/neutered before being adopted, and are&nbsp;tested for feline leukemia and feline AIDS (a cat strain, not related to human AIDS) and are given two leukemia boosters.&nbsp;All cats have a topical flea prevention applied and are microchipped. They are also dewormed and are given their rabies shot. </span></p>
