<p align="center"><strong>How we started...</strong></p>
<p align="center">The Tri-Lakes Humane Society was founded in 1942 by a group of teenagers concerned about the welfare of Saranac Lake's unwanted animals. The first animal &quot;shelter&quot; was a doghouse surrounded by chicken wire. When the young members found unwanted animals that they were able to take into their homes, they cared for them until a new home was found. At that time, the group called themselves the &quot;Adirondack Animal Welfare Society.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">In 1973 an office was rented on Woodruff Street in Saranac Lake, where paperwork was done, phone calls and messages were recorded, and donations were received. During that year, the group was renamed the Tri-Lakes Humane Society, and a motto was created...&quot;We speak for those who cannot.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">In 1975, with the help of Henry Uihlein and other generous donations, our first building was purchased and renovated to become an animal shelter. From then on, hundreds of animals were brought in and adopted out. In 1999, a policy was adopted by the Board of Directors to become a &quot;no-kill&quot; facility.</p>
<p align="center">In 1998, with our old building starting to become too small for our needs, a new property with a larger building&nbsp;at 255 George Lapan Mem Hwy in Saranac Lake,&nbsp;was purchased with donations by the Wigmore family and Hilde Roland. The building was an old restaurant and had to be completely renovated to become a state-of-the-art animal shelter facility. In January of 2001 we opened our doors to the public and since then we have taken in thousands of unwanted animals and have adopted out over 3,000 animals.</p>
