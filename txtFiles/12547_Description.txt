<p>The Humane Society of the White Mountains was incorporated in 1970 by a group of caring and dedicated individuals who were concerned for the plight of homeless animals in the area. Unfortunately, the beauty of our natural forests compel many irresponsible acts. Pets are often abandoned in the forests by people who truly believe that these domesticated puppies and kittens, dogs and cats will revert back to the wild and learn to fend for themselves. Sadly... they do not.<br />
<br />
Those of us who choose to serve and help homeless animals do so because the need is great and will never diminish. Our Humane Society houses over a thousand animals each year. Many are rescued from the forest, the streets and from lives of starvation and abandonment through our efforts. The animals we serve greatly depend on us.â€‹&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are&nbsp;the only open admission Humane Society in &nbsp;Apache and Navajo Counties. &nbsp;Animals cannot help themselves. They depend solely upon the generosity and compassion of humans. Our Humane Society is a private, non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention of cruelty to animals. The homeless animals we serve also rely upon the generosity and compassion of our supporters.&nbsp;</p>
