Rainbow Ridge Pet Rescue is a small all breed rescue group located in Tipton County TN.&nbsp; All of our pets are fostered in homes to learn housetraining, crate training&nbsp;and how to be an active member&nbsp;of a family.&nbsp; We do not adopt to &quot;outside&quot; only &nbsp;homes as this defeats our mission.&nbsp; All pets are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, heartworm tested ( treated if required) and placed on prevention.&nbsp; Other medical issues are addressed as needed.
