<p class="style78" align="left"><span class="style55">PawsWatch</span> is Rhode Island's volunteer network for feral cats. </p>
<p class="style70" align="left">We support the nationally recognized TNRM program (trap, neuter &amp; vaccinate, return, monitor). Founded in 1997 and approved as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in 2001, PawsWatch has provided veterinary care to more than 9,400 cats as of 2008 . Our goal is not to personally help every feral cat, but to teach Rhode Islanders to help the cats in their own neighborhoods. We provide resources, equipment and guidance to make this work possible. We believe that lasting change can come only from such a widespread foundation of community involvement. </p>
