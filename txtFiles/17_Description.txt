<h1 align="center">Happy Hills Animal Foundation Inc.</h1>
<h5 align="center">Cheryl Routh started Happy Hills in 1982 as a boarding and grooming kennel (boarding and grooming services are still offered). In 1986, she began taking in abandoned and abused animals, and placing them up for adoption. By 1989 the rescue work had grown so much that Happy Hills Animal Foundation was incorporated as a non-profit organization. Hundreds of dogs and cats, as well as other animals like potbellied pigs, rabbits, etc. have been rescued and adopted through Happy Hills. We are no-kill and adoptable animals may stay with us weeks, months, even years before they find their forever home.</h5>
<p align="center"><strong>Our mission is to furnish meals, warm beds, veterinary care, and love for the abandoned and abused animals that we shelter. We will find responsible loving homes for as many of these aimals as possible. Through humane education, and special programs for children, we will reduce the number of animals abused and abandoned in our community. Throgh spay/neuter education and by altering all the animals that are adopted from our foundation, we will reduce the number of unwanted animals born in our community.</strong></p>
