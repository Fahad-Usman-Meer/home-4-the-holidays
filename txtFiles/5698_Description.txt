<p>South West Animal Rescue Inc. is a not-for-profit organisation based in Bunbury, the South West of Western Australia.</p>
<p>South West Animal Rescue (SWAR) was established in November 2006 to address the lack of an animal shelter in the Bunbury area.</p>
<p>Our primary goal is to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome abandoned domestic animals.</p>
<p>SWAR rely on foster carers to house the animals while we are looking for their &quot;forever home&quot;. We are also actively looking at ways to establish an animal shelter at a permanet base in the Bunbury or surrounding areas.</p>
<p>SWAR are strong advocates of responsible pet ownership through sterilisation of family pets to prevent unwanted offspring. </p>
<p>We also believe in potential dog owners, researching and choosing the correct breed of dog to suit their lifestyle.</p>
