<p><em>Circle Of Hope&nbsp;dogs and cats come from our local kill shelters and rural back roads where many are dumped. We strive to find the pets that are in the most danger of losing their lives while at the same time making every effort to help our County residents&nbsp;in placing their unwanted pets into good, long lasting homes. We often help the elderly on fixed incomes feed their pets through trying times. We help by educating county residents on the benefits of spaying and neutering,&nbsp;we often&nbsp;help lower income pet owners with vaccinations and de-worming. We take unwanted sometimes abused pets and teach them to trust and love. We treat them for whatever ailment they may be suffering from - often malnutritian and dehydration combined with external and internal parasite issues. After an isolation period of no less than 14 days, they are available for adoption. Each animal will have age appropriate vaccinations, de-wormed, started on heartworm prevention, Frontline Plus applied and spayed or neutered. Most of our dogs leave our rural area and we are happy to say they have found wonderful, lifelong&nbsp;homes from FL to Canada, NY to CA and many places in between.</em></p>
<p><em>The COH Family wishes you and yours a very Merry Christmas and wonderful Holiday Season!</em></p>
