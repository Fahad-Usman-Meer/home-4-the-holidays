Fancy Feline Rescue of the South, a non-profit, no-kill rescue licensed by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, is a small rescue organization with a big heart for the &quot;Fancy Feline&quot; breeds -- particularly Persian, Himalayan, Exotic, Ragdoll, Birman, Maine Coon, Siamese, and other CFA- and TICA-recognized breeds and mixes. Our goal is to provide tender, loving care and safe-haven for those cats that are abandoned, abused, neglected, or no longer wanted by their owners, and to find appropriate, adoptive forever homes for each. While in our care, Fancy Feline Rescue of the South strives to give one-on-one socialization, providing the individual attention these cats so often need.
