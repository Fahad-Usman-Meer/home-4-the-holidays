<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#1285bc"><strong>NSW Animal  Rescue Inc</strong> was founded just over 3 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our philosophy is giving  life back to animals that would face certain death through painful neglect,  disease and illness. It is also about educating the public about the  responsibilities involved in raising and caring for an animal.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#1285bc">We care for  small breed, special needs animals.&nbsp; The special needs animals we take into our  care are able to be rehomed after they have had extensive &amp; often expensive  veterinary care.</font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font size="3" face="arial" color="#1285bc">NSW Animal  Rescue Inc. and the Community.<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a charity  within the community, our Rescue is about community. Our Rescue believes not  just in helping animals, but also the owners of the animals and the reaction of  the community as a whole to the caring of animals as family pets.</span></font></h3>
