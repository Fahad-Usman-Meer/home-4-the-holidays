<p>The Dessin Animal Shelter is a private, non-profit organization that was founded in 1968 by mother and daughter, Olga and Dorothea Dessin. </p>
<p>Since its beginning, Dessin has been a means of survival for thousands of unwanted animals that have been abandoned or surrendered for a variety of reasons. Each year up to 2000 animals pass through the doors of our small, rural shelter.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A non-profit organization with 501(c)3 status, Dessin is funded by donations from our supporters and fundraisers arranged by the staff. Adoption fees help to defray some of the expenses of caring for each animal. Every pet is neutered before adoption, as well as having been started on a vaccination and worming program.&nbsp; Cats are screened for feline leukemia before being placed for adoption. </p>
<p>We take our commitment to helping and caring for these animals very seriously. It is our goal to provide them with the best possible comfort and care we can while they are in our shelter.&nbsp; </p>
