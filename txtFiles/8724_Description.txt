<p>Welcome to Duncan&rsquo;s Place!</p>

<p>Duncan&rsquo;s Place is a non-profit organization dedicated to aiding homeless cats in Northern Colorado. We provide compassionate, safe havens for homeless cats through foster care until their forever homes are found.</p>

<p>We also endeavor to provide the Northern Colorado community with humane education and resources such as our pet food bank to help humans and felines live harmoniously together. Duncan&rsquo;s Place feels that we need to approach animal welfare issues on multiple fronts, bringing together community resources and providing not only animal care, but also pet sterilization and public education.</p>

<p>We rely heavily on private donations to house and save domestic cats in need.</p>
