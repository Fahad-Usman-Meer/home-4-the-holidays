<br />The Barn, founded in April 2009, originally started out as an equine rescue. Since then, when going to investigate horse neglect, we've found other animals, including dogs, cats, chickens, etc that need our help.<br /><br />

While our main goal is to promote the prevention of equine abuse, neglect and abandonment, we also rescue, foster and care for other animals.<br /><br />

Please visit out website to see pictures of our adoptable critters. :)<br /><br />
