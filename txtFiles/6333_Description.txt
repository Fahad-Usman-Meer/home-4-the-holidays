<p><strong><span class="style3">National Brittany Rescue &amp; Adoption Network</span></strong><span class="style3"> (NBRAN) is an alliance of dedicated Brittany rescue volunteers who share a deep love for the breed and who will work to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home Brittanys in need, whether abandoned, lost, stray or surrendered to rescue for placement. As volunteers united in a common cause, we are committed to the care of these dogs in foster homes, and providing for their physical and emotional needs. We are committed in our endeavor to help them with all the resources we have available. </span></p>
<p class="style3">We pledge to maintain a community of volunteers who treat each other, and the dogs they rescue, with respect, courtesy, kindness and love. We will seek always to lend encouragement and to support one another, and to facilitate friendly collaboration and cooperation between our volunteers. We believe that by building a supportive, dog-centered organization founded on respect, honesty and integrity, we will always remain focused on the welfare of the Brittanys entrusted to our care and hold their interests uppermost in our hearts and minds. Our mission is to place these dogs in safe, loving and permanent homes with approved applicants, and to provide a supportive network for our volunteers, who after all, make our goals possible.</p>
