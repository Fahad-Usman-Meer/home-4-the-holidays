<p>Our mission is to be a resource for animal shelters in the State of Washington who are in need of saving a dog from being euthanized when all other options have failed.&nbsp; We are all volunteers and we work as a 501(c)3 non-profit dog rescue organization.&nbsp; We will do our best to help dogs who are not able to find a forever home or foster home in their area. We will support our shelters by taking in dogs when they are full and their kennels are over-crowded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help us give these dogs another chance and connect them to their forever homes for the holidays.</p>
