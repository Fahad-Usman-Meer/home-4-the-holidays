<p>Hog Heaven works with the authorities and takes in neglected and abused hooved animals. We bring them back to health and find them forever loving homes. We are again experiencing the throaw away pot belly pigs again! &nbsp;PLEASE do your research and DO NOT fall for the breeders statement that they &quot;will stay 25#s&quot; &nbsp;We had have 27 surrender forms submitted since Jan 2016! There is NO SUCH thing as a teacup potbelly. &nbsp;There are many potbelly research sites out there, including I love potbellies on facebook. Learn from others mistakes!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Please visit us on the web, or stop by the farm to visit.</p>
