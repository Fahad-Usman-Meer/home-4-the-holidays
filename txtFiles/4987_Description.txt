<p>Please Save A Cat pulls cats from high kill shelters, gives them veterinary care and housing until they can be rehomed. &nbsp;We also take in cats from people who have found themselves homeless. &nbsp;We hold those cats until the owners can get back on their feet. And we house cats belonging to military personnel serving overseas, until they return. &nbsp;</p>
