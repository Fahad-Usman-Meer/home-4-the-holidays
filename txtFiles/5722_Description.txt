We are a small "boutique" rescue focusing on special needs cats:  the ones that would be euthanized on intake at a shelter and/or refused by the more traditional rescues.  In addition we have programs to take cats (very tolerant cats!) into schools to talk to students about responsible pet ownership as well as Snuggles 4 Seniors program to take cats into nursing homes.
