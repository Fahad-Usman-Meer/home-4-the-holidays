4 Paws Sake, Inc. is a group of volunteer (we  								have no paid employees) dog lovers whose mission  								is to rescue, provide sanctuary, and ultimately  								to re-home abandoned, stray and neglected dogs.  								We also assist dogs who, because of extenuating  								circumstances, are unable to remain in their  								homes with their owners. <br />
<br />
All dogs are housed in foster homes where they  								are provided with an enormous amount of love and  								any medical attention that may be required to  								insure that they are in good health before  								adoption. They are all spayed/neutered and  								brought up-to-date on vaccines before being  								placed in their forever homes.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are  								evaluated for temperament and personality. This  								helps us to place them in homes that are  								well-suited to their needs and to the needs of  								their future owners.
