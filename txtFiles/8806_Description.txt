Focused on<em> caring for and finding homes for senior dogs and cats, aged seven years and older where they can live out their golden years with dignity and love through rescue, foster, adoption, and hospice.</em></h2>

<h3>For any number&nbsp;of reasons senior dogs and cats are given up by, in many cases, the only family they have ever known. &nbsp;More often then not, they end up in animal shelters.</h3>

<h2><strong>Our Philosophy &amp; Goals</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>We &nbsp;believe that senior &nbsp;dogs and cats &nbsp; deserve a safe and caring environment in which to live out their golden years. We formed, Paws For Seniors, to help find these homeless pets a home where they can live out their lives with dignity and love.<br />
	●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We do not believe that we are&nbsp;&ldquo;in competition&rdquo; with rescue groups and shelters but &ldquo;in concert&rdquo;. &nbsp;We all have the same goal of helping animals in &nbsp;distress, caring for them, and finding &ldquo;furever&rdquo; homes.<br />
	●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We believe that pet companionship is key to keeping our aging society young at heart! We will work to match senior dogs &amp; cats with senior citizens, while considering the needs of &nbsp;both.<br />
	●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We work with rescues/shelters to network and cross-post Senior Dogs and Cats in their care to aid in finding a permanent home.&nbsp;<br />
	●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We established a network of foster homes that provide a safe and caring environment while we find a forever home.<br />
	●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We will establish a program to aid&nbsp;Senior Citizens to keep the companionship of their current pets.<br />
	●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We will work to bring awareness and educate to the public on humane animal welfare issues.</li>
