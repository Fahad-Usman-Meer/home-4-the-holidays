Owasso Feline Rescue was founded by Annette Sanders in 2001. We are a Non-Profit Organization that rescues felines off the streets, out of shelters, and from individuals.&nbsp; So far, we have done over 7,000 spays and neuters in the Owasso area and about 7,500 adoptions. We strive to teach the importance of spaying and neutering of your feline, not only for you but mostly for them. Adoption is the best thing you could ever do. Not only are you gaining a friend, you are saving a life as well.&nbsp; Our email address is owassofelinerescue@yahoo.com.<br />

<h3><strong><u>Who We Are</u></strong></h3>
<left> <font size="2">We are a private rescue and privately funded. WE ARE NOT A SHELTER, BUT A RESCUE. A rescue is a PRIVATE HOME and not a public place to visit. Adopters must make appointments prior to visiting our cats All of our cats are spayed/neutered, FIV/FELV tested, wormed, de-fleaed, and vaccinated prior to adoption. </font> </left><br />
