<p>Toronto Cat Rescue is a registered, no-kill Canadian charity run by volunteers.</p>

<p>Our mission is to rescue and find homes for abandoned, sick or injured cats from situations of abuse, neglect or imminent euthanasia.</p>

<p>Our vision is for Toronto to be a city in which no adoptable cat is killed and rescue organizations such as Toronto Cat Rescue are no longer needed.</p>
