<p>Fur-Ever Fosters is a small dog rescue that operates in the Michiana area. Although we do not take in large breed dogs, we will do everything we can to help you rehome your pet whether that would be with another rescue or one of our fosters until permanent placement is found. If you are in search of a large breed dog, we work with many rescues who may have what you are looking for.&nbsp;</p>

The mission of Fur-Ever Fosters is to rescue small animals from high kill shelters, owner surrenders and all abandoned/orphaned baby animals, provide loving foster homes whether it be fur-ever or temporary until a more permanent one can be found, to promote and facilitate responsible pet ownership, and to intervene in cases of animal cruelty.&nbsp;</p>
