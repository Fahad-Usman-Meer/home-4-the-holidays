<p>The Frances R. Willis SPCA serves the municipalities and communities located in Dorchester County in South Carolina.&nbsp; Annually, the shelter receives more than 4,000 abandoned, abused and lost animals. We strive to euthanize as few of the animals as possible. Some animals reside at the shelter more than 2 to 3 months before they are adopted. An emphasis is placed on adoptions and transferring animals who qualify to local, reputable rescue organizations. The shelter is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501 c3 non-profit organization and is registered with the SC Secretary of State&#39;s Office.&nbsp; The shelter is located at 136 Four Paws Lane in Summerville off Highway 78. The phone number is 843-871-3820. The shelter is open on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursdays from 12-5; &nbsp;Friday, Saturday, and Sundays from 10-5. We are closed on Wednesdays.&nbsp;To learn more about the Frances R. Willis SPCA, visit our website at <a href="http://www.summervillespca.com">www.summervillespca.com</a></p>
