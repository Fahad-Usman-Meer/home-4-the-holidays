<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The Campbell County Humane Society is a small non-profit organization made up of a handful of volunteers.&nbsp; Currently we don't have a shelter so we ask that any animal listed with us remain in their owner's home until we can find placement for that pet.&nbsp; We also have a very limited number of foster families that are gracious enough to open their homes and donate their time and love to a pet until it can be placed in a new forever home.</font>
