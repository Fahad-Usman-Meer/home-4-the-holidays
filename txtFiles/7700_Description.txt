We provide a safe haven for animals in transition, serve as advocates for animals and their people, work to end animal overpopulation and educate the public about compassion and responsibility towards all animals. Our shelter is a No-Kill facility where all incoming animals are evaluated, medically treated and rehabilitated when needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that does not receive any government funding and<span style="color: black;"> relies on the good will and generosity of individuals, corporations, and adopters.&nbsp; </span></span>
