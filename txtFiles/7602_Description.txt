Tails to Tell Animal Rescue Shelter is a small non-profit and no kill shelter located in Crossfield Alberta. Our primary focus is on injured, sick, and stray animals who would otherwise perish without our assistance.

Our animals live in a communal living environment, which has been shown to increase their happiness, health, and chances of being adopted. When you visit our shelter, friendly cats greet you at the door, hoping to catch your eye!
