Black and Orange Cat Foundation is a small group of volunteers working in the rural, farming community of Plain City, Ohio to decrease the feline overpopulation problem. We focus upon spay and neuter efforts, as well as Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) of feral cats. From the cats that we help with our sterilization efforts, we always come across nice cats and kittens that need homes. These lucky felines enter our adoption network of fosters until they find their forever homes.
