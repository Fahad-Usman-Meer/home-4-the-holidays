Founded in 1955, the <strong>Columbia-Greene Humane Society/SPCA</strong>  is dedicated to the protection, humane treatment, and well being of all  animals. This mission will be accomplished by our commitment to  community outreach, humane education and prevention of cruelty to  animals. We do not euthanize animals for space constraints and do not  receive any federal, state, or county funding.
