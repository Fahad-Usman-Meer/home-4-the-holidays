<p>CatBugs Pet Rescue is a volunteer based organization incorporated in 2008.&nbsp; We do not have a shelter facility.&nbsp; Our animals are kept in private foster homes until adopted.&nbsp; Our Mission is to help reduce the pet overpopulation in our community by promoting the importance of spay/neuter and responsible pet ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;At CatBugs, It is Never Too Late to Live Happily Ever After.&quot;</p>
