<p align="left"><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p align="left">Alley Cats and Angels is an all-volunteer, non-profit, 501(c)3 cat rescue organization located in the Triangle area of North Carolina. We are a no-kill rescue group committed to our cats being secure and happy throughout their lives. We believe that all cats have value and are deserving of safe and loving homes.</p>
<p align="left">All of AC&amp;A's work is accomplished by dedicated volunteers whose common objective is to improve the problems of the existing homeless feline population by simultaneously working towards reducing their future numbers through the combination of feline sterilization and public education</p>
<p align="left">Alley Cats and Angels recognizes the importance of partnering with other rescue organizations because together, we can maximize the difference we can all make in the lives of the Triangle's stray, abandoned, and feral cats. </p>
<p align="left"><em>Alley Cats and Angels is a network of foster homes. We do not have a shelter building. We take a limited number of friendly cats and kittens into the adoption program based on the space available in our foster homes. </em><em></em></p>
