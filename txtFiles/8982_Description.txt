<p>We are a breed specific rescue in West Tennessee dedicated to helping homeless, neglected German Shepherd dogs. &nbsp;We are a foster home based rescue &nbsp;not a shelter, meaning that our dogs are in homes where they are treated like members of the family working on any issues that they may have before they are adopted out&nbsp;</p>
