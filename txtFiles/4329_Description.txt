<p><strong>Our Mission Statement:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dalmatian Rescue of Tampa Bay</strong> rescues, rehabilitates, and re-homes as many Dalmatians from Florida shelters as possible that need our help.&nbsp;Our first and main priority is to take the Dalmatians who are facing euthanasia at high-kill facilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We</strong> assist area shelters in placing Dalmatians through ongoing advertisements in local newspapers.</p>

<p><strong>We</strong> thoroughly screen prospective owners with home and veterinary reference checks.</p>

<p><strong>We</strong> house almost 20 Dalmatians at our care-for-life sanctuary who are unable to be placed due to age and/or medical conditions.</p>

<p><strong>We</strong> provide ongoing support and education to all adopters.</p>

<p><strong>We</strong> spay/neuter all Dalmatians placed and give all medical treatment needed at time of placement.</p>
