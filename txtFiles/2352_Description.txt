LRRoF is a non-profit organization dedicated to placing purebred Labrador Retrievers in loving permanent homes. Our nonprofit organization is comprised of hardworking volunteers and vets that are committed to placing labs in new homes. We have been working together since 2000 and have rescued over 2400 dogs. <br />

LRRoF, Inc. provides foster care, veterinary care, and microchips for the Labradors in our adoption program. Our goal is to place our Labradors in appropriate, permanent homes. Prior to an adoption, we consider the history, temperament, personality, and energy level of the rescued Labrador. The placement process includes a written application and a home visit of the potential adopter. LRRoF, Inc. is committed to making a lifelong match for of all our adopted Labradors. <br />
