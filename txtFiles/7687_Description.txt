Southern Belle Pit Bull Rescue is a small rescue in eastern North Carolina founded to rescue, rehabilitate and promote the APBT breed.&nbsp; We believe there is a perfect home for every dog we rescue, and we work closely with our foster families and prospective adopters to make sure they have the support they need to welcome their dog into their family forever!!&nbsp; Education and responsible ownership are paramount in our quest to send Southern Belle Pit Bulls into the world as ambassadors for this great breed.&nbsp; Southern Belle Pit Bulls are the sweetest!
