<p>We are a cat and kitten rescue run purely by volunteers. We are located on the old Save-a-Pet compound. We care for cats that have chronic but treatable diseases and allow them to live in peace and dignity whilst adopting out healthy cats and kittens. We rescue cats and kittens in danger from euthanisation and other perils.</p>
