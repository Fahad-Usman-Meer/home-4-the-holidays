<p>Nine Lives Foundation is a 501c3 nonprofit no-kill cat welfare organization that works with the local community, TNR (trap/neuter/return) and rescue groups to reduce the over-population of homeless cats in northern California by providing low-cost spay/neuter services, vaccinations, health care and shelter for stray, feral, and at-risk cats.&nbsp; Nine Lives Foundation provides all necessary medical treatments for its shelter cats through an on-site veterinary clinic, and seeks loving, permanent homes for them, including those with physical, medical or behavioral disabilities. Nine Lives Foundation is celebrating its Tenth year of rescue!</p>

<p><span style="font-size:13px; line-height:1.6em">Nine Lives Foundation never uses euthanasia on a cat or kitten, except for humane reasons such as pain or suffering or when a cat has severe medical problems with a poor or grave prognosis.</span></p>

<p>The Nine Lives Foundation is located in large 5400 square foot warehouse in Redwood City. The front of the buidling contains the lobby/reception/exam room area, shelter hospital and spay/neuter clinic. The no-kill shelter/adoption center is located in the middle and rear of the building. The cats are primarily housed in walk-around enclosures, separating populations by age, activity level and medical needs although some cats prefer to live individually in large cages on the adoption floor. We have separate dedicated enclosures for FIV and FeLV positive cats. We are proud to be one of the very few facilities that accept FeLV and FIV positive cats and kittens, as the majority of animal shelters and humane societies routinely euthanize these animals.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:13px; line-height:1.6em">Kittens under 3 and 4 months of age are generally housed in foster homes to protect their delicate immune systems but we often have kittens older than 4 months in the shelter for adoption. We rely on our dedicated foster families to house our bottle babies and orphaned kittens until they are old enough to enter our shelter facility.</span></p>

<p>Our success in saving so many kittens each season is primarily due to the hard work of our volunteer foster families and we are so very grateful!</p>
