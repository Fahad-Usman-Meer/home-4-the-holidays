<p>The Galveston Island Humane Society is the Island&#39;s only shelter, providing open admission to assist all lost,&nbsp;homeless, or unwanted&nbsp;pets on our island.</p>

<p>We do not have a hold limit and work diligently to place all adoptable pets into loving homes or transfer to second chance organizations.</p>
