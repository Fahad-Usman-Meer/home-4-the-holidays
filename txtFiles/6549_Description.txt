Help A Hound, Inc. is a non-profit 501 c 3 canine/feline rescue. We are non breed specific.&nbsp; We rescue from high kill shelters and puppy mills.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to find forever homes for these deserving pets.&nbsp; We spay and neuter all pets prior to them being placed.<br />
<br />
We are strictly volunteer run and operate solely on donations and fundraisers. If you wish to donate to this worthy cause you can do so by going to Paypal and using donate@helpahound.com or visit our website and read our wish list page.<br />
