<font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS, cursive">WY Rat Terriers Rescue is a not for profit volunteer run rescue. We strive to provide a safe, loving, home environment for Rat Terriers who are abandoned, abused, neglected, or homeless while they await a safe loving lifelong home of their own. We are committed to educating current and prospective owners on the special needs and temperament of Rat Terriers in order to promote responsible ownership and to prevent future displaced terriers.<br />
