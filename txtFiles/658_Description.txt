<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS,Monaco" size="2">The CPR Fund is a non-profit organization founded by Northwest Indiana EMT's and Paramedics. We are dedicated to improving the health and well-being of the voiceless members of our community. Through fund raising events, educational programs, and community service projects, we intend to provide support to public service organizations in Northwest Indiana. Animal Control shelters, schools, and child welfare agencies are just a few of the programs we will be supporting.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Monaco" size="2">As our first order of business, we are working to improve the quality of life for the homeless dogs in our community through&nbsp;CPR Fund Canine Rescue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Monaco" size="2">Unfortunately, most municipal Animal Control departments are grossly under-funded and under-staffed. In general, each town has one officer to catch and care for all the animals. Most officers work seven days a week to feed the animals, clean kennels, provide transportation to and from veterinary appointments, and maintain records.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Monaco" size="2">Also, most animal control facilities are housed in out-dated, run down buildings. The dog kennels are usually small and lack outdoor access. In order for a dog to get some fresh air, he or she must be put on a leash and taken for a walk. With all their other responsibilities, it is often difficult for the officers to find the time to provide the dogs with adequate exercise. Some facilities are not air conditioned or even lack hot water.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Monaco" size="2">Most Animal Control Officers attempt to adopt out as many animals as possible but do not have the staffing or the resources to run a successful adoption program. And sadly, most Humane Societies and foster programs are already over-crowded and can not accept any animals from Animal Control.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Monaco" size="2">Our goal is to provide a no-kill sanctuary for the dogs due to be euthanized only because there is nowhere to place them. Only adoptable animals will be accepted. Once under the care of the CPR Fund, volunteers will work tirelessly to find these animals their forever families.</font></p>
