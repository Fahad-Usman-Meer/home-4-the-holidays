            <p align="center"><strong>Fur the Love of Paws is an Charitable, 501c3 organization started by a group of dedicated animal lovers, with a combined 25+ years of rescue experience, who wanted to make a difference in the lives of homeless animals. Currently being operated by volunteers and foster homes, our goal is to provide a shelter for homeless, neglected and unwanted cats and eventually dogs and to open a center to provide sanctuary for animals where euthanasia is never an option for a healthy</strong> <strong>animal. <br />
            </strong></p>
            <h1 align="center"><em><font color="#339966" size="4">We are working tirelessly to raise funds for a new facility to operate in!</font></em></h1>
            <p align="center"><br />
            <strong>By opening a facility without having to rely on foster homes, we will be able to greatly increase the number of pets we can help. We will be able to offer shelter to those animals that may need some extra time before they are adoptable, and offer sanctuary for those who may never be ready.</strong> </p>
