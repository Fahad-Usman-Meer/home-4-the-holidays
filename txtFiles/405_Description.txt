We are growing and now have a transition shelter for the animals waiting for space at the adoption center.&nbsp; The number one animal that needs our help are CATS.&nbsp;&nbsp; We spay/neuter and microchip everyone that comes through our program.&nbsp; We don't want a revolving door of adopting out pets that breed or get lost and end up back in a shelter.&nbsp; We help about 500 pets from local animal control officers&nbsp;each year.
