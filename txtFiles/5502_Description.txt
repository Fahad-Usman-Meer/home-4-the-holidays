<p><strong>As a 501(c)(3) animal rescue organization, Stray Central&rsquo;s goal is to prevent hundreds of companion animals (i.e., dogs and cats) from going to over-crowded area shelters each year, shelters where most of them would certainly be euthanized.&nbsp; The main function of Stray Central is to spay/neuter, vaccinate, tend to the medical/emotional needs, and provide a safe haven for as many homeless, unwanted, and abused/neglected companion animals as possible until they can be adopted into loving, forever homes.&nbsp; Our second purpose is to be a devoted refuge where cats with severe medical, emotional, and/or behavioral problems can spend their remaining days with love, understanding, and without the threat of euthanasia.&nbsp; Stray Central&rsquo;s third, but no less essential role is to be a source of information for pet owners and to educate the public about the importance of spaying/neutering their pets and all other aspects of responsible pet ownership.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are a cat-only rescue.&nbsp; By not having a shelter facility, we&rsquo;re not equipped to take in other animals &ndash; but that doesn&rsquo;t stop us from doing what we can to help any creature in need!&nbsp; While we do occasionally rescue dogs and other animals, we simply aren&rsquo;t set up to care for them.&nbsp; In those situations, we work with other rescue groups that are better prepared to assist them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stray Central is not a shelter.&nbsp; Instead, we are network of dedicated foster homes where our rescued cats live with and become a loved member of the foster parents&rsquo; families until they find their forever homes.&nbsp; Because we are not a shelter, we have the advantage of being a no-kill organization &ndash; but it also limits the number of cats we can take at any given time.</strong></p>
