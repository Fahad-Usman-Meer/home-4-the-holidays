<p>Too many older dogs are put to sleep or abandoned to fend for themselves. </p>
<p>Forclosures and hard times make for tough decisions regarding the family pets. </p>
<p>Shelters are even hard pressed to find homes for them. Many times they have conditions such as poor vision or hearing. Some worse. </p>
<p>I am in the process of obtaining funding for a project to care for them. By fall we hope to be ready to shelter and care for several.</p>
<p>I am also organic farming. Apple Orchards, Gardening and older pets&nbsp; take patience and a labor of love. They go together great. </p>
<p>If you wish to help with our endeavor, please contact us...Thank you...Joe</p>
