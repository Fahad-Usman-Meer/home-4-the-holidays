<p><strong>Keller&rsquo;s Kats Rescue, Inc</strong>. is a not for profit 501(c)(3) animal rescue organization that was formed in October 2014 and is completely volunteer run. We are a dedicated group of individuals who work tirelessly to find suitable homes for abandoned, lost and surrendered animals in jeopardy of euthanasia in and around Rochester, NY.</p>

<p>We do not have a shelter facility we operate with a network of foster homes which provide sanctuary for our rescue animals. The number of animals we can help depends on how many foster care parents we have.</p>

<p>Since we are a no-kill organization, unless medically warranted, no animal in our program is ever euthanized to make space for any other animals. We provide all necessary medical care before placing animals in permanent, loving homes</p>
