Background: In 2007 TLC Animal Shelter proudly marked its 33-year milestone of serving the community and providing a safe haven for homeless, abused, and abandoned animals.&nbsp; TLC started from humble beginnings, but today boasts of a beautiful shelter that provides care for an average of 4,000 animals a year.&nbsp; Although the majority of animals TLC helps are made up of dogs and cats, we help any animal in need, including birds, reptiles, rodents, livestock and wildlife.<br />
<br />
TLC is a not for profit organization run entirely on contributions, and various fundraisers that are held throughout the year, to enable us to provide the care needed for these animals. We are grateful to all of our contributors and our hard working volunteers for helping raise the money to do all of this.<br />
<br />
Programs: TLC not only helps the animals, we offer tours and information on animal care to scout and school groups.&nbsp; TLC volunteers have also done programs at a local safety village teaching children how to prevent being bitten.&nbsp; One of our proudest accomplishments is our VIP Program, which is seven years old.&nbsp; This is a group of dedicated volunteers that bring animals to visit senior residences and shut ins to brighten their day.<br />
We also have a special fund called the &quot;Bertha Fund&quot; for animals in need of more extensive medical care.<br />
