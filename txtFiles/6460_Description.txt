Welcome to Puppy Luv-HARTS.<br />
<br />
Puppy Luv-HARTS stands for Helping Animal Rescues and Training Services. I started Puppy Luv this summer of '09 by taking in one dog from a friend of mine that she rescued from Wexford Animal Control, and then I went on from there helping her by taking in more rescues because they were being put down just to make room. All of the dogs and puppies here are great dogs, they just needed someone to take the time to show them love and as well as some obedience training.<br />
<br />
My goals for Puppy Luv-HARTS is to help by taking rescue dogs in, getting them back up to satisfactory health, if need be (many come to me skin and bones from malnutrition), and obedience training them, then finding them suitable, permanent homes. My goals for obedience training them is to make them more acceptable to society because they are well mannered. And because of being well mannered and minding, this will ensure that once placed in a permanent home that they will stay there forever. To do this, takes time and patience to work with them and understanding them. Some of the dogs that come to me are not only malnurished, but have been abused as well, which takes a lot of time and patience to earn their trust, help them work through issues that can be worked with, and show them what is acceptable behavior if they are ones who act out in fear, or just to get the dog emotionally stable again.<br />
<br />
Many rescue dogs have gone on to become service dogs, search and rescue, therapy dogs, companion dogs to ederly people, ones who are house bound, or even those who are autistic or depressed, and many other service related jobs that more than gives back to mankind and our communities because they add value to our lives. To take the time to work with the dogs and train them, is very much worth the effort.
