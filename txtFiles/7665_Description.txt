We are an Animal Welfare Society Situated in Trikala, Thessaly, Greece

 Our Mission is to rescue as many unwanted, homeless & ill treated "dogs & cats", and to care for them at our shelter, then to hopefully re-home every animal in our care to loving homes and for the less fortunate to ensure that they have a home ï»¿for life at O ARGOS.

Our Goals are

To provide the very best for all the animals in our care, ensuring they receive food, shelter, medication, sterilization and above all to offer all our animals the chance of a new life in a loving home, and if they cannot find a home, that they are guaranteed a home at the shelter for the rest of their days.
To establish a hospital on the premises, operated by a group of vetenarians, which will be open to the public and people that love their animals, but cannot afford the medical expenses that they are confronted with.
To develop an educational program with the local schools and the public.
We want to open our doors to all schools, universities and corporate business for community service initiatives and finally to achieve a working relationship with the community, that they feel welcome to visit the shelter, and share with us the problems encountered in their neighbourhood / township with all the domestic animals, so that we can plan, educate and assist people, to treat these GOD GIVEN CREATURES, that have no voice, with the respect and honour which they deserve, that we as humans should be displaying at all times.
 

Our staff is knowledgeable in identifying the temperaments of the animals before they are put up for adoption to determine the appropriate environment.
