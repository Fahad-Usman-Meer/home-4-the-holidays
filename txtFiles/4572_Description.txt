<p>Friends of the OCAS is a group of dedicated volunteers with hearts of gold to help and support the homeless pets at the Orleans County Animal Shelter.&nbsp; It is our goal to assist with adopting pets to their forever homes, locating dog owners, providing needed items for the shelter to help care for its homeless pets and raising community awareness of the plight of homeless animals.&nbsp;</p>
