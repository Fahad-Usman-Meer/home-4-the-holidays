We are a small group of animal lovers that rescue mostly small breed dogs from kill shelters and other animals in need, and place them in  foster homes until they can be adopted out to   forever homes. We specialize in special needs and animals needing  rehabilitation due to disease or injury. We are not a shelter. We are a  small ALL volunteer group that places homeless animals   into foster homes to await their forever homes.
