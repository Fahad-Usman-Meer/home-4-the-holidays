<p><font face="Tahoma" size="3">We have been rescuing Dachshund or wiener dogs since 1991 and have placed 450+ dogs.&nbsp; DRNW is known for taking in the tough cases of neglect or abuse as well as family pets too and re-training them all to find them forever homes with a successful rate of adoptions at 95%.&nbsp; We love our breed and like finding great homes for the rescues after 36 years in the breed.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="3">Plus we have the Dachshund Club of Spokane and have monthly wiener events for doggy fun, public education and socialization for all the dogs that come play with us for training days, adoption events. Wiener Dog Races, costume contests,&nbsp; BBQs, Wiener Walks in the Park and more free family fun.&nbsp; See our web site for more details, </font><a href="http://www.spokanewienerdogs.org"><font face="Tahoma" size="3">www.spokanewienerdogs.org</font></a><font face="Tahoma" size="3">&nbsp; </font></p>
