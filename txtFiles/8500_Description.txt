<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>

<p>Our mission is to rescue unwanted dogs and cats that are in shelters and pounds located throughout Southern Idaho and parts of Utah and find them their forever homes. We place each animal into our foster home program while we search for forever homes for them. We focus on those animals that are considered &ldquo;hard to adopt&rdquo; for various reasons; like kennel stress, having a black coat, being over 8 years old, etc.&nbsp; Often a foster home rather than a shelter environment helps give many of these animals a second chance at the life they deserve!</p>
