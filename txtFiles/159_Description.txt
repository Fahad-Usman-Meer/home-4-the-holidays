<p>Shih Tzu Rescue, Adoption and Education Safehouse (S.T.R.A.E.S.) is an all volunteer, not for profit,&nbsp; no-kill, licensed shelter, established in 1999 to provide sanctuary, loving care and an adoption program for abandoned and relinquished Shih Tzu.&nbsp; Our mission also includes two special programs.&nbsp; (1) Small adoptable dogs with injuries and medical ailments that are costly to treat and who would otherwise be scheduled to die are given the extra-ordinary medical care and lengthy rehabilitation they need to live happy complete lives.&nbsp; (2) Neglected and abused Shih Tzu with behavior issues ranging from aggression to fear that have the potential to become loving family members are enrolled in a remedial program with a professional trainer/behaviorist so they too can be successfully placed in &ldquo;forever homes.&rdquo;&nbsp;All dogs are kept in a cageless home-like environment with access to over two fenced-in acres where they can run free.&nbsp; Our Shih Tzu are spayed/neutered prior to adoption, current on annual inoculations and heartworm preventative and have an AVID microchip implant.&nbsp; Complete veterinarian wellness checks are done on all incoming pets and any necessary special tests, medical and/or surgical procedures are provided.&nbsp; Regularly scheduled grooming, parasite checks and treatment are also included as a part of our routine care.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All dogs are temperament and personality tested so adopters can be matched with a dog that will best suit their expectations and lifestyle.</p>
