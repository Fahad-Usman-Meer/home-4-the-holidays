<p>HuskyNLab Rescue is a small home based rescue. We currently are&nbsp; not not for profit, we will be working on this in the year 2010. We run solely out of pocket and from&nbsp;adoption fees&nbsp;so any donations we recieve are greatly appreceiated. We specialize in rescuing purebred huskies and labrador retrievers. Our mission is to provide loving homes for these unique breeds.</p>
