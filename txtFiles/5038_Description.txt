<p>We are a non-profit, ALL volunteer 501(c)(3), animal rescue group, dedicated to saving unwanted, pregnant or nursing, homeless dogs and cats, and their offspring. These animals are placed in foster care, nursed back to health, tested, vaccinated, microchipped and spayed or neutered. Once ready for adoption, all potential candidates are screened by Adoption Counselors, who will then approve only candidates that best meet the animals needs. We are a NO-KILL animal rescue group! All animals are fostered in homes until adopted. In 2013 we adopted out over 1,200 animals and have saved over 8,000 in our short&nbsp;six year history.</p>
