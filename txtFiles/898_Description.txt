<p>Four Paws Rescue is a non-profit, volunteer-run organization that is dedicated to helping&nbsp;homeless dogs and cats. Four Paws Rescue rescues stray and abandoned cats, dogs, puppies and kittens from high-kill shelters.&nbsp; We place them in caring foster homes (if available) and then adopt them into loving homes. We have placed over 4,000 companion animals into adoptive homes since 2005, while enriching the lives of their adoptive families</p>
