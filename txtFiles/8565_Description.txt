<p>The Lovejoy Foundation is a recognized California Public Charity with the Internal Revenue Service with a 501(c)(3) status. We rescue abandoned, neglected and abused dog, puppies and kittens off the streets of Los Angeles. We offer an alternative to the shelter for owner surrenders. We treat medically, fully vet and rehome all of our rescues. They remain with The Lovejoy Foundation until they find their forever loving homes, regardless of how long that may take. We are a no kill organization that is supported &nbsp;by the vision of the founder and the generosity of our incredible volunteers.&nbsp;</p>
