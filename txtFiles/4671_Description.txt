<p>Save Our Cats and Kittens (SOCKS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit free roaming shelter and adoption center. &nbsp;Our mission is to help cats and kittens in the community by providing a no-kill, clean, healthy and safe homelike environment while waiting for a forever home. We rely&nbsp;solely on donations, fundraisers, and our thrift store to fund our operations. We are capable of housing up to 100 cats and kittens and, on average, we adopt out 300 cats and kittens annually. We depend&nbsp;on a small number of paid employees and many volunteers.</p>
