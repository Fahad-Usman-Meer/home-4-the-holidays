18 Shades of Grey transports retired racing Greyhounds from the track to our home before adopted. Dogs are evaluated as to overall health, temperament, behavior and all information is documented upon arrival. Dogs are brought to special events in the community where we can educate the public of these retired racing dogs needs as well as taking applications for adoption. </font></div>
