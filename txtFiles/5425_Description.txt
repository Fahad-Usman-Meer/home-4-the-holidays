<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Home FurEver would like to welcome you to the group! We take pride in our rescue organization as we are the only no-kill rescue in Detroit that rescues the dogs that we foster.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Home FurEver is a non-profit, no-kill, foster based canine rescue that takes in all dog breeds.&nbsp;The group was officially started in 2003 and has rescued, rehabilitated and re-homed almost 3,000 dogs and puppies. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not discriminate against any dog or any breed; we give everyone a chance to live a normal healthy life.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Our dogs primarily come from the rough streets of Detroit.&nbsp;We find some as strays running the streets or in abandoned houses or automobiles.&nbsp;There are occasions when a dog rescued is in very poor health.&nbsp;Other groups may humanly euthanize the dog, but our dedicated vets do everything they can to save our dogs so they can start their lives over with a loving family.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We also take in dogs periodically from kill shelters, other rescues and owner surrenders.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">All of our financial support for food and veterinary care is from generous donations and fundraising.&nbsp;At any given time, Home FurEver could have anywhere from 60-90 dogs that are in foster care.&nbsp;That makes us one of the largest foster based rescues in the metro area.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; That also means that we are always looking for more donations, more volunteers and more foster parents.</span></div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Our mission is simple; give every dog a chance to find its FurEver home. </div>
