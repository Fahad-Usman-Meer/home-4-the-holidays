<p>Saving Grace Animal Rescue of Maryland was founded in 2013 by Executive Director, Lauren Bourdon.&nbsp; We operate entirely out of foster homes, so we are able to give potential adopters information about how the cats and dogs under our care interact with their families and other pets.&nbsp; We pride ourselves in finding the best match for all of our animals and applicants.</p>
