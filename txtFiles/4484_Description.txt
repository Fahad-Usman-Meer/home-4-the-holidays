We are located in Western Washington State. </strong></font></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Countless dogs are without homes and in need of assistance. These are dogs who would make wonderful and faithful companions if only they could connect with the right person or family. We have made it our mission to help them do this. At the same time we hope to enrich the lives of those who adopt them. </font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 1px"><font size="2">We strive to match our dog's needs and personality to the preferences and requirements of each potential adopter. We believe this is a crucial component of the process and will help ensure a life-long relationship.<br />
<br />
Our primary focus is on small purebred or mixed breed dogs, although we do occasionally take in larger dogs. We work collaboratively with <a href="http://www.peopleunitedforpets.com/animalshelters.htm">shelters</a>, other rescue groups, and individuals, both locally and nationally. We are a service organization operated entirely by <a href="http://www.peopleunitedforpets.com/howyoucanhelp.htm">volunteers</a>. <br />
<br />
We have no central facility. Our dogs are placed in <a href="http://www.peopleunitedforpets.com/ourfostervolunteers.htm">foster homes</a> around the greater Seattle area where they receive socialization and training while they await adoption.</font></p>
