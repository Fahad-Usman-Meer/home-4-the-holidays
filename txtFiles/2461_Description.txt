<font size="3">HorseNet Horse Rescue is a certified 501 (c)(3) nonprofit facility located in&nbsp;Maryland. We DO NOT sell horses, but facilitate the rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming of those animals in our care. We do have some permanent residents, but strive to adopt out as many animals as possible to loving informed homes. We are 100% volunteer run and operate solely on donations. We will adopt out to individuals who are residents of Maryland or to individuals that reside within 2.5 hours of the New Windsor rescue.</font>
