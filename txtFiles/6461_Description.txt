Lost Our Home Pet Foundation is a grassroots, no-kill pet rescue based in Scottsdale Arizona. Founded in June 2008, it is the only animal rescue in the Valley dedicated to saving pets abandoned, or at risk of homelessness, due to foreclosure, eviction, or other financial hardship. Our core programs and services are linked to the human-animal bond, extending beyond the pets to include pet owners. Services include (1) pet rescue, (2) a pet food bank, (3) pet friendly rental service, (4) a temporary foster program, (5) pet adoptions, and (6) promotion of, and assistance with, spay/neuter surgery. In our first 3 years of opening we have rescued over 1,350 cats and dogs, and through the LOH food bank, fed approximately 7,000 more, allowing these pets to remain with their families.
