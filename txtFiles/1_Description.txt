<p><a href="javascript:void(0);/*1343843775666*/">Helen Woodward Animal Center</a> is not just another no-kill animal shelter.</p>

<p>Located in San Diego, Helen Woodward Animal Center is a unique, private, non-profit organization dedicated to saving the lives of animals and enriching the lives of people. For more than 40 years, our no-kill Center has provided humane care and animal adoption for orphaned animals, as well as animal-centered educational and therapeutic programs for people. The Center is a dynamic, evolving institution that is an agent of change for the animal welfare world. Not only are we operating innovative and beneficial programs for animals and people, but we are teaching others around the world how to successfully market and promote their animal adoption and humane programs and stop the senseless death of thousands of animals.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not an animal <em>shelter</em>, we are an animal <em>center</em>. That means we turn away from the perception of the pass&eacute; term &ldquo;dog pound&rdquo; and instead become whatever our community needs; an all-inclusive &lsquo;center&rsquo; that helps the community&rsquo;s animals, its people, and educates its children.</p>
