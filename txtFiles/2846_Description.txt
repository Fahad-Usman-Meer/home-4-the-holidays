Cats have a special way of warming our hearts and mending our souls when we are worn down.&nbsp; They also keep us young and energized with their amazing personalities.&nbsp; Older cats have a hard time finding a home because that cute, little kitten, playing with the stuffed mouse, creates such spectacular show that is impossible for an older cat to touch.&nbsp; Older cats are filled with wisdom and love and make an addition to any family more complete.&nbsp; Please consider adopting one of these guys that have waited so patiently for the opportunity to go to a warm, loving home.<br />

&nbsp;Lori is a 4-5 year old, tortie, female.&nbsp; She is a very sweet cat that hates the cage she is currently living in.&nbsp; She really wants a loving family to take her home and share their love with her.&nbsp; She was found and had not been well taken care of at all.&nbsp; After we fed her and got her back to her normal self, she was a pleasure to have around.&nbsp; She has tested negative for FELV/FIV.&nbsp; This picture doesn't do her any justice, but she is not very photogenic for us to get a better one!&nbsp; Come and meet her to see how cute she really is.&nbsp; Lori is extremly sweet. Please adopt Lori! <a href="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q305/wearepaws/Lori.jpg">i139.photobucket.com/albums/q305/wearepaws/Lori.jpg</a><br />
