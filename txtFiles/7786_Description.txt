Our mission has always been to rescue as many dogs as need our help.&nbsp; We will rescue a dog, have it vetted for any injuries, illnesses, etc. Get the dog up-to-date on vaccinations. All dogs are either spay or neutered in our rescue. <br />
As happens with some rescue dogs who have had a hard life before rescue, we do run into some behaviour issues, non-socialization with Puppy Mill dogs, etc.<br />
Our volunteers are trained to work with the dogs to help transition them from rescue to a healthy, adjusted member of your family. </div>

<div class="mvm uiP fsm"><span class="fwb">Company Overview</span></div>
We rescue small dogs with big hearts! We are a volunteer group that helps primarily Boston Terriers, Boston mixes and other small dogs when resources permit. We rescue locally and all around the country - if our help is needed. Check out our Adoptable pet list to see the most current available dogs.<br />
<br />
We do not have a shelter so there are no set visiting hours or place to visit. We foster all the dogs in foster homes in various locations. <br />
<br />
Friends of Homeless Animals, Inc. is now an approved tax-exempt Public Charity under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.<br />
