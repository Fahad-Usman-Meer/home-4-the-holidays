<p>We are a volunteer-run, publicly-funded rescue dedicated to the welfare of the Keeshond breed.&nbsp; Our mission is to ensure that all Keeshonden receive the loving home they are due.&nbsp; We also&nbsp;strive to educate the public in the proper care of this magnificent breed.</p>
<p>To that end, we rescue, rehabilitate and rehome needy and unwanted Keeshonden from shelters, owner turn-in and puppymill situations.&nbsp; We do this all with the help of a dedicated team of very talented individuals.&nbsp; Our rescue dogs spend their days in the homes of our volunteers, in anticipation of a wonderful forever home.&nbsp; We do this only with the help and financial support of those who love the Keeshond breed.&nbsp; We receive no government grants or special funding, only donations from those who know there is no greater dog than a Kees.</p>
<p>Please join us in making a difference in the life of a needy Keeshond.&nbsp; There is no better companion and friend!</p>
