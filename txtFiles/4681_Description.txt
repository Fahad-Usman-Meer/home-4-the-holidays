Dorothy H.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Connor Pet Adoption Center (DOCPAC) provides homeless animals a caring environment with the purpose of the adoption of dogs and cats into their own homes. Known formally as Six Flags Humane Society, the new facility was established in 2007.&nbsp; With the help of our knowledgeable staff, we continue to provide quality service to ensure that your pet leaves healthy and happy. <br />

The Dorothy H O&rsquo;Connor Pet Adoption Center is dedicated in memory to Dorothy Hanna O&rsquo;Connor (1907-1992). Having established Victoria&rsquo;s first community animal rescue center, the new facility builds upon her vision to prevent cruelty to animals through the facilitation of the adoption of all God&rsquo;s creatures.&nbsp;<br />
