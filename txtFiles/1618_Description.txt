<p>The Macon County Humane Society is a no kill nonprofit animal organization in Macon County that rescues stray and abandoned dogs and cats. We educate the public, provide vaccinations for our shelter animals, low cost spay &amp; neuter to both public and shelter animals as well as micro-chipping and ID. tags to both public and shelter animals. We have 100 loving animals at the shelter right now who need a forever home so please help us help them come to the shelter and adopt or at lest volunteer to spend some time with them. Paws and licks from all of our furry friends.</p>
