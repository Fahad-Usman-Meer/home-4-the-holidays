<div id="company_overview0-essay-full" style="">My name is Lisa, my  spouse and I Occasionally rescue animals.We will not take in a animal  unless we have the time and room in our residence to do so.We are a  Non-Profit,Private and Independent animal rescue.<br />
We take in animals  that can no longer be cared for by their owners,have had unexpected  litters,have been neglected, abused, unclaimed,injured and the list goes  on. <br />
Whatever the reason, we take them in and provide love,care,training,food and safety,all at our own expense.<br />
<br />
If  we do not have room to take a animal in at the time,we do offer a  courtesy posting for your animal on our Pet adoption portal site and ask  that you foster the animal until it can be adopted or room in our  residence becomes available.We do not  encourage you to take the animal  to a shelter, due to the chances of it being put down.<br />
<br />
**If you have any questions,or just need help,please feel free to email me at: Lisa@Ncanimalrescue.freehomepage.com**<br />
