<p>We are a local independent organization founded in 1967.&nbsp; As such, we are not affiliated with the National Humane Society or the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), nor do we receive funding from these organizations.&nbsp; Our adoption center is a 100% donor funded no-kill shelter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;There is nothing stronger than the heart of our volunteers.&quot;</p>
