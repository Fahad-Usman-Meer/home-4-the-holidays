<p>The Joplin Hu<img alt="" src="http://www.joplinhumane.org/uploads/2/9/4/4/29445721/1400080595.png" style="float:left; height:84px; width:183px" />mane Society was incorporated with the state of Missouri in 1948 and has serviced Southwest Missouri 60 years since its inception.&nbsp;In the mid 1970&rsquo;s the organization<br />
assumed responsibility for housing animals from Joplin Animal Control when the City run pound was closed. In 1976 the Society received its IRS designation as a 501(c)(3) non profit corporation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many years the Joplin Humane Society has&nbsp;a significant increase in the numbers of pets collected annually.&nbsp;This is due in part to evidence that the surrounding communities cannot financially maintain individual Shelter operations with many closing or ceasing operation.</p>

<p>Working in substandard conditions in a building built to house 2,000 animals a year, the annual influx of animals into the shelter rose to 12,000.&nbsp; These numbers were the catalyst to initiate a capital campaign for a new animal shelter.&nbsp; Construction began in June, 2009 and the 20,000 square foot, state-of-the-art facility was opened in February 2010.</p>
