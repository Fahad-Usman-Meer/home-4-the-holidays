<p><font face="Arial">The Humane Society of Rockdale County, Inc. was founded in April 2008. We met and are still meeting much resistance from our county government and our local Animal Control Facility. The main reason is there was a shelter here years ago that had 1000 animals or more in a trailer park. This left a very bad impression on the community as a whole. It has been an uphill battle and will continue to be one until the zoning issues have been resolved and the community stands behind me and the ordinances get changed in order to permit private shelters to exists at all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The fight is worth it though, when I get tired and I feel like quitting and I'm crying &quot;Mikey&quot; my Rottie mix comes lumbering up and puts his head in my lap for a pet and I realize where would he be without our little shelter to fight for him? His family was going to give him away that day no matter what, Even if it meant he had to die. He adds such peace to my life when he comforts me. I can't imagine getting through this without him.&nbsp; He loves me so much he rarely leaves my side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I know he's going to find the right home someday and he'll move on and I'll cry but it will be like heaven for him. My house or &quot;Shelter: is just a half way house&quot; of sorts I guess. It's only better than death. I know this. It could be so much more. I dream of it being so much more.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Our goal at the&nbsp;Humane Society of Rockdale County is to bring the world of Human Society&nbsp;and the animal world closer together. We believe that EVERY healthy animal, not just dogs and cats, but birds, reptiles, rabbits, horses...All of the earth's creatures deserve to be treated with respect. As a society&nbsp;we can do one of two things, we can close our eyes, turn our heads and ignore the problems that mankind has created by domesticating&nbsp;many of these animals and do nothing, or we can choose to&nbsp;take another path. We can embrace the discarded and lost pets in our communities and bring them into our homes and make life better for the least of these trying to survive in our society. </font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#8b4513">&quot;People who are trained to extend justice, kindness, and mercy to animals become more just, kind, and considerate in their relations with each other. Character training along these lines will result in men and women of broader sympathies, more humane, law-abiding and in every respect more valuable citizens. Humane education is teaching in the schools and colleges of the nation the principles of justice, goodwill, and humanity toward all life. The cultivation of the spirit of kindness to animals is but the starting point towards that larger humanity which includes one's fellow of every race and clime. A generation of people trained in these principles will solve their difficulties as neighbors and not as enemies.&quot;</font></strong></p>
