<p>Hurricane Pets Rescue (HPR) is a 501 C3 animal welfare organization that operates a small shelter-sanctuary for abandoned and homeless cats and kittens in Miami Florida in addition we have foster homes all over the Nation. At our facility in Miami at any one time we have a total of about 60 cats and kittens in residence.</p>

<p>We do not have the man power nor a big enough facility to accomodate dogs and puppies, therefore we place all dog in carefully screened foster homes until adoption.</p>

<p>We are primarealy a distaster relief organization , but our rescue work is 24/7 365 days.</p>

<p>As an animal welfare and sheltering organization, our goal is not only to find the animals we rescue &ldquo;forever&rdquo; homes, matching the right cat with the right owner, but to keep them safe, healthy and happy until that time comes along.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t believe in &ldquo;warehousing&rdquo; our animals. We strive to offer them a safe and stimulating environment.</p>

<p>One of the toughest problems shelters face is the spread of disease among the resident animals.</p>

<p>Not only do close quarters facilitate the transmission of diseases but the stress of being in a shelter (even the nicest shelters) also contribute to the transmission of disease.</p>

<p>Here at HPR we are not willing to accept the transmission of disease as a given and do everything possible to keep our animals healthy.</p>

<p>Most of the animals in our shelter are seniors and animals with special needs and those that nobody wants we do have highly adoptable animals too.</p>

<p>In addition to keeping the animals in our care happy and healthy, and working to find them their forever homes, we also spay/neuter all animals in our care and do TNR of feral cats in different communities in South Florida..</p>

<p>Spay/neuter not only benefits the animal and their potential owner by affording health benefits and curbing undesirable behavior but it benefits the community at large by making a direct and meaningful hit on the problem of animal overpopulation.</p>
