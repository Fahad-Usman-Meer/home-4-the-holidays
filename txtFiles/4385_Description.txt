Eskie Rama (http://www.eskie-rama.com) works to find homes for American Eskimo Dogs in Las Vegas and occasionally Southern California.

We focus on the most in need Eskies.  If a dog is in a kill shelter and has been timed out - we will step in and save the dog.  We foster in our own home and work our contacts to find the dog a loving home.

We enjoy to educate the public on animal issues such as spay/ neuter and breed rescue. We also help Eskie owners find solutions to problems they encounter.
