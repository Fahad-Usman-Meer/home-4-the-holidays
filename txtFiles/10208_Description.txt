<p>Act NOW! Rescue is a not-for-profit no kill organization committed to saving dogs and cats, both stray and those in euthanizing shelters, in order to nurse them to health through our foster care system and place them into loving, adoptive homes. &nbsp;We will demonstrate responsible guardianship for our animals and offer educational programs to present information about animal over population, spay and neuter, how to be a responsible pet guardian, and safety for pets and their owners.</p>

<p>Our service areas include St. Louis County, Jefferson and Franklin County in Missouri where we work to help reduce pet over population through our spay and neuter programs as well as offer spay and neuter services to low income families.</p>
