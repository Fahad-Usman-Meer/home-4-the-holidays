<p><strong>Who We Are -</strong></p>

<p>We are a small foster only shelter who helps people who cannot keep their pets. We attempt to re-home with-in the state but do have out of state contacts as well. We deal with dogs, small to medium, cats and occasionally, when space permits, farm animals, fowl, bovine and equine.</p>

<p><strong>Turn in Your Pet?</strong></p>

<p>All pets turned in must be spayed or neutered, or half of the cost of vet check and altering will be made from the family turning in as a donation directly to the vet in our name. Our vet gives us a very fair price, so this is rarely a hardship. In case of hardship we do have benefactors who will assist. Not all pets are accepted, a general temperament test must be given first by one of our volunteers, at no cost.</p>

<p><strong>Want to Adopt a Pet?</strong></p>

<p>All adoptive home will pay a small rehoming fee, provide personal and vet references - who will be asked to fill out a short for on your behalf, sign it and return it to us. Rehoming fees help cover costs of food and care. Rehoming fees vary by pet.</p>
