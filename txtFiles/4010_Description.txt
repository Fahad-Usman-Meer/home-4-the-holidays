<p>We are a small&nbsp;<strong>NO-KILL</strong>&nbsp;home-based shelter in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Jamaica Plain and a network of loving foster homes, friends, sympathetic veterinarians and feline rescuers, working to reduce the number of homeless cats in our backyards and on our local Boston streets. We are strictly NO-KILL. We believe that no one has the right to judge (as many shelters do) who is deserving of his or her own life. We euthanize only when a veterinarian concludes an animal is terminally ill with no hope of recovery. We are always asked our hours of operation. We are not staffed during the day, we receive no state, city or federal funding, we are all volunteers who give our time and money for love of the animals. We all work paying jobs during the day and care for the animals every evening. We use many private foster homes, so potential adopters must be screened first and come by appointment only. All adoptions involve completing an adoption application, vet and/or personal reference checks, and a nonprofit adoption fee which helps to recover our costs, and supports our work.</p>
