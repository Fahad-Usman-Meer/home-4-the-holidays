Victoria Pet Adoption Society (VPAS) is a volunteer run, registered charitable foundation in Victoria, BC, Canada. VPAS' goal is to rehabilitate homeless animals and place them into great homes. VPAS provides medical care for all of their adoptees, ensuring that their vaccinations are up to date, and that all adoptees are spayed/neutered and tattooed (when possible). <br />

The Victoria Pet Adoption Society is funded solely by adoption fees, fundraising events, and donations from the public. The cost of keeping the animals is considerable, and we rely on these donations to continue to care for the animals while they are staying with us, waiting for their new homes.
