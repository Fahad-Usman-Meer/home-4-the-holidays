<p>Southern Ohio Animal Rescue is a small rescue located in Shade, Ohio. We specialize in dogs, and perfer giant breeds, especially great danes. But, we also take in just about any animal that needs a home. We often have dogs of all sizes, ages, and breeds, cats, and we do small animals, birds, and even farm animals. </p>
<p>We make sure our dogs are current on shots, Heartworm tested, and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. If the animal is not able to be spayed/neutered, then they are adopted out on a spay/neuter contract. Our adoption fees are based on the amount of money spent on vet care &amp; general care of the animals.</p>
<p>Please email me today to recieve an appliaction to adopt one of our wonderful pets!</p>
