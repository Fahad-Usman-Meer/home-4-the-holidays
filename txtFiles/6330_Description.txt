<p>Tobys Tales Wildlife rescue&nbsp;is a non-profit volunteer organization dedicated to helping orphaned and injured wildlife, returning them back into the wild, rescuing exotic pets and finding homes or sanctuaries for them. &nbsp; We&nbsp;promote&nbsp;the human-animal bond, preventing animal cruelty, educating children and adults about responsible pet ownership and preventing pet overpopulation. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="line-height:1.6em">Our goal is to place these animals in permanent homes with responsible, loving pet owners. All of our services are provided through private donations from our community.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OUR MISSION</p>

<p>Our mission is to educate the community on the need for responsible pet ownership, including the spaying and neutering of dogs and cats. We also assist in the rescue and placement of abandoned, stray or injured animals. &nbsp;Helping families pick the right pet for their family in hope&nbsp;that with the right pet we can reduce the amount of animals taken to shelters or dumped. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
OUR VALUES</p>

<p>In kinship with all living things, we respect, preserve and protect the quality of life of the animals in our community and in the wild.&nbsp;<br />
