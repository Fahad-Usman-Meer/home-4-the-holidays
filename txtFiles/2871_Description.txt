<p>We are a family run animal rescue in rural Louisiana. Our focus is cats. However, we also have some rescued cats, puppies, and other animals. We are in the process of raising funds to build a hurricane proof cat shelter on our back property, as our home is overflowing with adoptable cats and kittens. You can see our available pets at <a href="http://mycatranch.petfinder.com">http://mycatranch.petfinder.com</a> You can view our photo site at&nbsp;<a href="http://mycatranch.textamerica.com" /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mycatranch/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mycatranch/</a> We also have a video site at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mycatranch/">http://www.livevideo.com/mycatranch</a>&nbsp; If you see an animal you are interested in adopting, please contact us at <a href="mailto:mycatranch@gmail.com">mycatranch@gmail.com</a> if you would like to schedule an appointment to meet one or more of our adoptable pets.
