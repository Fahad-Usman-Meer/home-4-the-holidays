<p>The Hermitage No-Kill Cat Shelter was founded in 1965, and has been a leader in the field of animal rescue and welfare ever since. We are dedicated to the philosophy of No-Kill, working to make Pima County a no-kill county. No cat is ever destroyed to make room for another, nor because they are &quot;unadoptable&quot;. They are loved, protected and rehabilitated so that homes can be found for them.</p>

<p>We are both an adoption facility and long-term sanctuary for those felines who are &ldquo;adoption-challenged.&rdquo; including felines who are FIV or FeLV-positive, and other types of chronic health issues.</p>

<p>The Hermitage Cat Shelter is a not-for-profit 501(c)3 organization supported entirely by donations. We are dedicated to the shelter, protection, and care of homeless cats, especially those that are often not considered adoptable by other organizations. We are an adoption facility and long-term sanctuary for those felines considered &ldquo;adoption-challenged,&rdquo; including felines who are FIV or FeLV-positive or have other types of chronic health issues. All of our kitties roam free within 9,000 square foot of outdoor/indoor living space.</p>

<p>We were awarded sanctuary status in 2013, from the American Sanctuary Association.</p>
