No Kill Central KY Regional Humane Society provides community assistance to the unwanted animals of central KY & beyond. Our shelter works hard seven days a week, 365 days a year to provide onsite care and feeding to the animals we shelter.
We have an active adoption group who works all throughout the week & on the weekends with adoption events at local partners.
We are an ALL volunteer shelter that needs the support of our community and those like minded animal lovers who want to be the "VOICE for the VOICELESS".
