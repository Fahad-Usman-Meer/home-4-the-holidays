<p align="center"><font color="#003300" size="2" face="Verdana">Operating on the southside of Indianapolis and into upper Johnson County, IndyCLAW's focus is on rescuing exotic pets. While we would not turn our backs on a dog or cat in need, we fill a need for an exotic pet shelter. Exotic pets are small mammals, like rabbits, hamsters and the like; birds like parrots, cockatiels, parakeets, etc; small farm animals like chickens and non-migratory ducks. As you can see from the photos, we get alot of dogs and cats in as well. If one of our fosters happens to have room, or we can find someone to foster them on our behalf, we don't turn them away. We work with a lot of other shelters and can at least redirect the animal in need to a more specific resource.</font></p>
