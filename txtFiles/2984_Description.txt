<strong><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: " face="'Comic Sans MS'">We do our very best to save as many of these fur kids as we can.&nbsp; Some of these fur kids have been tied to trees and left to die by their owners.&nbsp; Some have been dumped on a country road to fend for themselves.&nbsp; Some people will even shoot&nbsp;a stray dog if they come on their property.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A lot&nbsp;of these fur kids have never known love&nbsp;and affection of any kind until they came into our rescue.&nbsp; We do everything in our power to show them that they are safe and loved.&nbsp; Soon the dogs come out of their shells and return the love that&nbsp;we give them.&nbsp;&nbsp;What trusting souls these fur kids have.&nbsp; They hold no grudges on humans for treating them the way they do.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
