<p>Saving The Animals Together (S.T.A.T.) was formed in April 2012&nbsp;. &nbsp;We have been a 501(c)(3) since December of 2013. We focus on homeless and abandoned companion animals in Madison County TN. We network the animals that come into our local high kill facility, work with other rescues to save these animals as well as running our own foster based rescue. All of our animals are fully vetted before being adopted out to carefully screened families and individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition we look for ways to encourage and support responsible pet guardianship. We have monthly pet food distributions to pet loving families in financial crisis, We offer low cost microchipping to the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have recently been accepted as a partner with Pets for Patriots are looking forward to helping heroes adopt a companion animal.&nbsp;</p>
