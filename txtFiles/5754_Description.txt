AFL offers an alternative to animal control shelters by housing the animals in foster homes until they can be placed for adoption into loving, permanent homes. We are committed to reducing pet overpopulation by providing 100% spay/neuter for animals in our care and strive to build lifelong friendships that will enrich the human-animal bond. </font><br />
