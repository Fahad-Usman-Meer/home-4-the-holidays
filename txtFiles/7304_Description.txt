<strong>Best Friends Dog Rescue is located in Cairo, Ga. A non-profit organization. We rescue puppies/dogs that are abandoned, mistreated or unwanted. All of our rescued puppies/dogs are veterinary checked, vaccinated, spayed or neutered, on heartworm prevention, then placed in secure loving homes. We highly promote spay and neuter in our community due to the amount of stray animals found&nbsp;and the unnecessary number of animals euthanized weekly in our local shelters.</strong>
