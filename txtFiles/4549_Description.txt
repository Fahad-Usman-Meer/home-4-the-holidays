<p>We are a home based rescue. All rescues and foster dogs live in my home with my person dogs, cats, and children. This gives the dogs a chance to be raised in a family environment and get the love and attention they deserve. Only bullies with sound temperament will be adopted out. We do not usually accept owner surrenders, but will in exceptional circumstances. And on the very rare occasion we take in cats and kittens. Most of our dogs come from shelters and animal control facilities. It takes a special person to adopt a bully, please consider all aspects before adopting. Adoption is for life! Below are two babies looking for loving homes for the holidays! Yoda and Pumpkin!</p>
