<p><strong>CLEAR LAKE ALL BREED RESCUE</strong> is a foster-based adoption group based in the Clear Lake City, southeast Houston, Texas. &nbsp;We have a network of individuals and families that provide foster care for animals (some too young or sick for adoption) until they can be adopted into loving, responsible homes.<br />
<br />
</p>
<div>Our pups and kitties are fostered in&nbsp;loving home environments where they live <strong>indoors</strong> with their foster families.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since all our pets are in foster homes,&nbsp;please <a href="mailto:info@clearlakeallbreedrescue.org"><font color="#003399">email us</font></a> to schedule an appointment to meet them.</div>
