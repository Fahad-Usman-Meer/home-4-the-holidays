Animal Welfare Foundation of Iowa is a tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) organization. We realize that the stray dogs in many Iowa counties have no animal shelter to take them in and therefore, have no chance of being adopted. In many areas, stray dogs are held for 7 days and if not claimed, are automatically euthanized. Most dogs are not claimed because their families have intentionally abandoned them. Animal Welfare Foundation is working to give these dogs and cats a chance to be adopted into secure, caring homes. Our efforts have saved the lives on homeless animals in the following Iowa counties: JONES, LINN, JOHNSON, CEDAR, POWESHIEK, BENTON, KEOKUK and MUSCATINE.
