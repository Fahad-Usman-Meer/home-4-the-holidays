PAWS mission is to rescue, shelter and adopt healthy dogs and cats and provide educational and charitable services to pet owners in Plaquemines Parish. As a part of that mission, PAWS educates community members on responsible pet ownership including the benefits of spaying/neutering pets as well as providing information on pet care, training and maintenance.

As a non-profit organization, PAWS relies solely on donations from caring individuals, businesses, friends, adoptions and fundraisers. Donations pay for surgery, spaying/neutering, vet care, immunizations worming and medicines. Donations also help pay for dog/cat food, and special diets for kittens/puppies, and sick animals.
