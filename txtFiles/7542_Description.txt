<p> 	Serving Indianapolis and the surrounding counties since 1905, the  Humane Society of Indianapolis provides vital services to animals and  people alike through sheltering and <a href="http://indyhumane.org/index.php/find_pet">adopting animals</a>, providing <a href="http://indyhumane.org/index.php/services/behavior_training">positive reinforcement behavior training</a>  for both adoptable animals and for owned animals through our public  training classes, and outreach through our community and shelter  programs.</p>
<p> 	A private, nonprofit organization that receives no public or private  government funding, the Humane Society of Indianapolis is supported  solely by contributions, grants, bequests, investments, adoption fees  and other fees for service. We receive no tax money, United Way funds,  or regular contributions from other animal-welfare organizations such as  the ASPCA, Humane Society of the United States, or Peta.</p>
