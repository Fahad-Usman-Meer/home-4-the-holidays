<p>founded in 1987, Guardian Angels Pug Rescue is a non-profit, 501C3, NO-kill rescue organization that specializes in Pugs but will accept Pug mixes, English Bulldogs, French Bulldogs and Boston Terriers as space permits.&nbsp; We have an adoption process that includes an application, reference checks and a home inspection.&nbsp; we make sure all rescues receive proper vet care and are spayed/neutered, up to date with vaccines, heartworm tested and put on preventative, and if money allows, micro-chipped.</p>
