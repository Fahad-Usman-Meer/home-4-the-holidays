<p>For almost 30 years, Pet Project Foundation (PPF) and the San Clemente-Dana Point Animal Shelter have been united in a unique partnership to provide pro-humane care to the lost and abandoned animals of our two cities. With PPF providing significant financial support, as well as donating over 25,000 hours of volunteer time each year, the shelter is able to ensure that every animal in its care will have a safe refuge until a permanent, loving home can be found &ndash; no matter how long that takes.</p>
