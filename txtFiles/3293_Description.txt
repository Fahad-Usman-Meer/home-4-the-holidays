Westfield Stray Cat Rescue has been in operation for less than a year, but we are very proud of the number of strays rescued, 72 so far, and 50 have already found new homes. Our rescues recieve veterinary care, the basics and a loving foster home to care for them until they are adopted. All of our cats are spayed or neutered before they go to forever homes. It's great to be part of the rescue community.
