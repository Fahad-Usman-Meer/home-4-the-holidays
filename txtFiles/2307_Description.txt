<p><font size="3" style="width: auto;">The Mountains' Humane Society was formed in 1975 by a group of mountain residents who shared a concern for the welfare of local cats and dogs.&nbsp; We are a non-profit 501 c3&nbsp; volunteer organization that <br />
aids domestic animals on our mountain range from Cedar Pines Park to Forest Falls.&nbsp; We offer spay/neuter assistance, emergency medical assistance, lost and found information, information on animals available for adoption and much more. We do not have or own a shelter, kennel or even an office.&nbsp;We rely on foster homes to keep our homeless pets until an adoptive home is found.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font size="3" style="width: auto;">We rely on private party donations to keep us up and running. We do not receive any federal, state or county funding, and there is no trickle down funding from the Humane Society of the United States, ASPCA or any other larger animal rescue/protection groups. Being a 501 c3 non-profit organization, we gladly provide tax receipts for donations.&nbsp; We are also a volunteer organization, so your patience and understanding are very much appreciated. We can always use more hands to help. <br />
If you have a talent or skill&nbsp; that you could lend to us, or if you can provide a foster home for us, please give us&nbsp;an email!&nbsp; </font></p>
