<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>Four Paws and Tail Rescue was founded by an 18 year old girl. She has always had a big heart for animals, even at a younger age.&nbsp; Four Paws and Tail Rescue was founded in Ocotober of 2006.&nbsp; FPTR's mission is to save animals (dogs AND cats) from inhumane situations, abusive/violent situations and situations in which the animal(s) are neglected. We take these animals into our care and give them&nbsp;proper medical&nbsp;care, proper food and socialize them. <br />
<br />
AS of right now, this rescue is very small.<br />
<br />
We pay for everything out of thier pockets. There many times when the medical costs become very high. No matter what these animals recieve medical care ASAP! We use a variety of different vets for our animals. One vet we use is called Cherry Hill Dog and Cat Hospital they are very close to our home and we have had many emergencys and they have been kind enough to take us in. Cherry Hill doesn't do low cost spay/neuter or shots, but when we have had 2 cats needing C-Sections and kittens that were ill they took us with no problem. They have been very kind to us, especially when we had some kittens pass away. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>For low cost shots and felv/fiv testing we go to the shot clinic held by Luv My Pet. They go to different Petcos (petco chrisitina and in wilmington). They have packages for testing, distempe shots, rabies shot, felv shot etc... They hold them on every Sundays from 9-12.</strong></font><br />
