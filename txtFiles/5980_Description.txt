<strong>Save A Sato </strong>is a non-profit organization dedicated to easing the suffering of Puerto Rico's homeless and abused animals. &quot;Sato&quot; is slang for street dog. We rescue Satos from the streets and beaches, give them medical care, food and shelter, and plenty of love. When they are healthy, we send them to one of our shelter partners for adoption into loving homes
