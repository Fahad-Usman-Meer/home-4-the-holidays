<p>Rescue Pit, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) not for profit pit bull rescue. We are committed to saving lives by creating a network of advocates in Rochester, NY.</p>

<p>Pit Bulls are flooding our city shelters and fighting a negative stigma that stems from humans, not nature. Extremely loyal&nbsp;and eager to please, Pit Bulls are taken advantage of because of their unassuming and accommodating nature. It&rsquo;s not fair and it&rsquo;s time to return the favor.<br />
<br />
Rescue Pit is a centralized network of like-minded people. We wish to promote a public awareness of these misunderstood dogs through a collected and unified front. Education is a must and re-homing these dogs is our top priority. It&rsquo;s not just about the rescue &ndash; it&rsquo;s about education, caring, saving lives, and giving dogs a real home. When these things come together more lives can be saved.</p>
