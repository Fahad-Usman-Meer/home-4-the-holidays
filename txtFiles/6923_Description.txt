Have A Heart, Inc. is a small, volunteer Canine Rescue in South Florida.  We save dogs from Death Row and keep them safe until a new home can be found.

Our mission is to Rescue, Re-home and Educate.
We are a certified 501(c)(3) Non-Profit, No-Kill Organization.
Because we are in no way associated with any government agency or animal control facility, we are funded entirely through our fundraising efforts and contributions from caring people like you.

We make every effort to make our adoption process as easy as possible.   However, it is imperative that we take steps to ensure that each dog is the correct match for each family and that each dog will have a safe and loving home.
