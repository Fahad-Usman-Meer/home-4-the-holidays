SART is a non profit cat rescue/adoption sanctuary which currently houses 340 cats and kittens.&nbsp; We are a cageless, no kill shelter where the animals live as they would in homes.&nbsp; Therefore they are social, loving, well mannered, as well as being fixed, innoculated and ready for adoption.&nbsp; To contact us please email <a href="mailto:Sue@SARTohio.org">Sue@SARTohio.org</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
