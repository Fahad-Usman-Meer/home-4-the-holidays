<font face="Arial">We are a small reptile rescue group the cares for the health and welfare of all reptile.&nbsp; We take in abused, abandoned, or unwanted reptiles. &nbsp;&nbsp; We work with&nbsp;the animal until it is ready for adoption; some stay with us for education or retirement. <br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;Our animals are used in public and private school education programs, Girl and Boy Scout programs, and public events (Earth Days, Pioneer Days, etc).&nbsp; Some are permanently placed in public school classrooms. <br />
