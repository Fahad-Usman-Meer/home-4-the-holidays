The Hudson Valley Humane Society has subscribed to the "no-kill" philosophy for nearly 25 years.  We are a private organization and derive 100% of our operating budget through voluntary donations and special fund raising events.  We are the ONLY organization in Rockland County (New York) licensed to provide Humane Law Enforcement and we are the only organization that trains the police department and peace officers for this purpose.  All personnel are volunteers.  Visit our site at www.hvhumane.org to learn more about us and to view our animals for adoption.  Thank you for considering adoption!
