<p>Serendipity German Shepherd Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit, 100% volunteer organization dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing of German Shepherd Dogs who have been abandoned, abused or neglected. Based in Missouri, we do our best to assist dogs throughout the entire Midwest states area. If our program is full, we network with other German Shepherd rescue agencies and help transport dogs to safety in their programs.</p>
