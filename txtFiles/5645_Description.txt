<font face="Tahoma">Since November 2005, The Urban Rabbit Refuge has been providing short- and long-term care for rabbits that are considered difficult to place due to illness, injury, and/or behavioural issues. The health of each rabbit is assessed at intake and appropriate medical care is provided. Where health permits, we spay/neuter. At present, we are caring for more than 60 rabbits. When space is available, we take in rabbits that are considered adoptable, spay/neuter, and find them loving forever homes. <br />
We are funded by public donation. Please help us by contributing toward the cost of the medical care we provide at the refuge.<br />
