<p>Bully Paws is a small, but very successful&nbsp;501 (c), (3), non-profit rescue organization. All of our animals come from kill shelters. Many of our rescues occur on the actual day the animal was scheduled to be &quot;put down.&quot; </p>
<p>Before being adopted from us, all puppies and dogs will be neutered/spayed, micro-chipped, crate trained, dewormed, provided heartworm testing and prevention, all shots will be brought up to date,&nbsp;in most cases they will be housebroken and all of them will have been given extensive temperment evaluation. </p>
