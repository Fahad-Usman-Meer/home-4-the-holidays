We are a 501(c)3 public charity. Our organization serves WI, MN and IA. We rescue, rehabilitate, retire, and rehome cocker spaniels and mixes regardless of health problems. We incorporated in July 2006 and have rescued 151 dogs since being incorporated. The average time a cocker is in our rescue is 4 weeks. We also have a retirement program for cockers too old for adoption. All of our dogs are spayed or neutered prior to adoption.
