Peewee's Pet Adoption World and Sanctuary was established in 1995.
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Peewee's Animal Shelter is located at 1307 Saratoga and has been in operations since May, 1997. Peewee's presently houses&nbsp;over 300&nbsp;animals, including dogs, puppies, cats, kittens as well as, pigs, goats, rabbits and other barn animals. Peewee's relies on donations only for its operation. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dogs are kept in a &quot;backyard&quot; atmosphere, and currently occupy about&nbsp;35 yards and individual kennels. They are not confined to runs or cages. Sick or rehabilitating pets are kept isolated to receive medication and special care. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shelter operations are accomplished strictly by donations. Our biggest contributor, HEB Food Stores, donates all the dog and cat food, plus a healthy supply of kitty litter. Peewee's does not get any government, city or federal funding. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Peewee's helps those animals no one else will - the sick and the stray. The volunteers at Peewee's work tirelessly to rehabilitate poor orphaned pets in the hopes that they will find new, loving homes. The dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, given regular heartworm preventative, and are on flea &amp; tick prevention and medications as needed. Peewee's does not discriminate due to age or health conditions of the pet. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prospective families are thoroughly screened. The adoptive family must&nbsp;go through an application process to obtain a pet. The adoption fee&nbsp;is only $95 for a dog and&nbsp;$55&nbsp;for a cat.&nbsp;Even this low fee is waived for any animal that has been at our shelter for over six months. &nbsp;We currently have over 100 grown kitties that are free to good homes.&nbsp; Fees include sterilization and vaccinations. Peewee's also happily accepts&nbsp;donations to help in caring for the animals. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are many families in the Corpus Christi area who are grateful to Peewee's for the loving pets they currently have in their family.</font></p>
