<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Fix A Cat, Inc., preventing unwanted street cats in Norman, Oklahoma and the OU Campus. One TNR (trap neuter/spay, release) at a time.&nbsp; Fix A Cat is a nonprofit incorporated organization aimed at reducing and stabilizing unwanted feral cat populations via trap, neuter/spay and release program in Norman. Fix A Cat is not a rescue shelter, animal abuse hot line, for-profit organization, or cat sanctuary. However, in the process of TNR we run across adoptable strays and/or kittens that we will rescue and put into foster care. Once they are socialized and a certification of clean health they are put up for adoption for a &quot;Forever Loving Home&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">How can the community help? We ask that the community responsibly spay or neuter pets and not abandon them for any reason. In order for us to reduce the number of feral cats in Norman, we also ask the community to help us with monetary assistance. Licensed veterinarian sterilization is paid for by donations made to the organization and in-kind vet service discounts. </font></p>
