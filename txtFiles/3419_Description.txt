German Shepherd Rescue is located close to beautiful downtown Burbank.&nbsp; Our street address is 417 Moss Street,&nbsp; just north of Magnolia Blvd. and east of Buena Vista St.&nbsp; From the 101 fwy., take 134 east to the Buena Vista St. exit and make a left heading north.&nbsp; At the t-intersection traffic light you make a right turn,&nbsp; followed by a left onto Buena Vista and a right onto Magnolia.&nbsp; Moss Street is on the left hand side just opposite the Burbank Water and Power building.<br />
<br />
We have many beautiful German Shepherd dogs,&nbsp; male and female,&nbsp; of all ages and temperments.&nbsp; Our volunteers spend many hours getting to the know each individual dog's personality so that we can help to advise you and find the perfect dog to fit your particular home, needs and lifestyle.&nbsp; Our goal is to help each adoptive &quot;parent&quot; find the dog of his/her dreams,&nbsp; and to find wonderful &quot;forever homes&quot; for each of our loving dogs.<br />
<br />
In order to adopt one of our pure German Shepherd dogs,&nbsp; and in order to assure that each dog finds a forever home on this--&nbsp; his or her second opportunity at a great life,&nbsp; we do require that you complete a pre-qualifying application,&nbsp; which can be found on-line.&nbsp; We encourage you to complete the application&nbsp; prior to your first visit to be certain that you qualify for adoption of one of our very special dogs.&nbsp; Not all applicants will be approved.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
We are open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays from 1:00PM until 5:00 PM.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing you at German Shepherd Rescue and hope to find you a &quot;forever dog&quot; to join your family.&nbsp; Have a wonderful Holiday and a Happy and joy-filled New Year.&nbsp; <br />
