SCAT Street Cat Rescue Program Inc. has built a solid foundation and an excellent reputation of hard work and commitment since 1996. A registered charity, we work to support caregivers and potential caregivers, in both residential and business areas, by providing:<br />
<br />
- funds for spay/neutering<br />
<br />
- a helpline for such things as socialization, relocation, trapping, medical issues and neonatal kitten care<br />
<br />
- a network between foster homes and adopters<br />
<br />
- advice, moral support and hands-on assistance to businesses, acreage owners, and novice caregivers<br />
<br />
- educational materials and information sessions to promote public awareness of the suffering of homeless/feral cats directly linked to non-compliance with the spay/neuter philosophy.
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.petfinder.com/gifs/yarn1.gif" /> SCAT promotes the use of TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) when it is in the best interests of a feral animal; however, we promote TNFA (Trap-Neuter-Foster-Adopt) whenever possible, especially for young kittens rescued from the streets.</p>
