I am a very small rescue, that usually only has 2 to 4 animals at a time. I work full time, and dont have alot of time to attend adoption events,but I have very good luck placing pets through my veterinary friends. I pay for all their care out of my own pocket and provide them with wonderful care. They are all spayed and neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm and flea prevention.
