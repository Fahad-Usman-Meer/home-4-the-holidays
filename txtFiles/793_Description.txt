<p>SOS DOGS is a 501c3 non-profit small dog <strong>RESCUE</strong>. Because <strong><em><u><font color="#ff0000">we are a rescue and NOT A SHELTER</font></u></em></strong>, we don't have a physical location to come see dogs. <font color="#ff0000">Our dogs are in private foster homes</font> in the area. </p>
<p>In order to adopt, you must go to our website, <a href="http://www.sosdogs.org">www.sosdogs.org</a>. Click on ADOPT A DOG and you can read about our requirements, fees, and procedure. Click on DOGS FOR ADOPTION to see the dogs we currently have.</p>
