The St. Charles Humane Society is the only no kill facility in St. Charles County, MO.&nbsp; We do not receive&nbsp;tax dollars or any support other than private donors and through our adoption fees.&nbsp; All of our adoptable animals are spayed or&nbsp;neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, wormed, dogs are tested for heartworm and are on preventative, cats are tested for FeLV and FIV prior to adoption.&nbsp; We offer&nbsp;educational programs to interested groups or schools on all animals topics from dog bite prevention,&nbsp;animal care&nbsp;and how volunteers can help animals.&nbsp; We also offer a pet food pantry, AniMeals (named with permission&nbsp;after the Helen Woodward program) to supply food to the pets of people who could not otherwise afford to keep their animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;This program resulted from many calls made to the shelter from people needing to surrender their animals due to financial hardships, and the only thing they needed was food they could not afford.&nbsp; We had a surplus of food types we do not feed to our shelter animals, and we devised a program to feed the animals in their homes, preventing them from becoming homeless and filling a cage in our facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed&nbsp;us to take in an animal&nbsp;off the street&nbsp;or from&nbsp;another shelter when their time ran out, saving yet another life.
