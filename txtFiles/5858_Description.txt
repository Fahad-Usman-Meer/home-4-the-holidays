<p>Wags and Whiskers Rescue is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, volunteer-run organization. <br />
<br />
We actively promote low-cost, high-quality spay/neuter service cats, dogs and rabbits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization also runs a small rescue with adoptable pets.&nbsp; Our rescue pets are pulled from county animal shelters&nbsp;and&nbsp;are placed in qualified foster homes where we can continue to train and socialize the pets. </p>
<p>Wags and Whiskers Rescue &nbsp;has made a difference in the lives of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp; pets by providing low cost spay/neuter and by placing our adoptable pets in loving homes. <br />
