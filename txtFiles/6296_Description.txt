<div><font size="2"><font face="comic sans ms,sand"><strong>The need for an active humane society in Coffee County is great and the interest in animal welfare is widespread.&nbsp; We believe that many citizens of Coffee County are ready and willing to improve the conditions of animals in our county and only need a venue to channel their help and energy.&nbsp; The core group that is already working for animal welfare&nbsp;has many different talents and interests and we have been able to work effectively together on many programs already, including fostering horses, dogs&nbsp;and cats, assisting low-income families with pet care medical and nutritional needs, and working in cooperation with local shelters to improve the rates of dog adoption and thus reduce euthanasia rates.&nbsp; Our focus is to continue to grow our core programs and increase our focus on helping low income families spay and neuter their pets</strong></font>.</font><!--"''"--></div>
