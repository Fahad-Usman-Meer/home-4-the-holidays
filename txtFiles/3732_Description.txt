Our adoption fee is a great deal! For about half of what it would cost yourself, or $110.00, you get a dog who has been heartworm tested and is on preventative; on Frontline for fleas and ticks; wormed; vaccinated for kennel cough, distemper combination and rabies; and spayed or neutered prior to going home.
