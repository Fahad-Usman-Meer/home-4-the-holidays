We Care Feline Rescue is run out of McMinnville, Oregon but we are helping felines in the entire Portland Metro area. We are a registered LLC with the State of Oregon and are applying for our 501c3 status with the federal government and hope to hear an approval by the end of this year. <br />
<br />
We Care is based around just that..CARING! We will treat all felines as members of our family until it is time to adopt them to their new forever families. <br />
<br />
Our Mission: We Care Feline Rescue is committed to taking care of the unwanted, strays and helpless felines, rahab or raise them to be happy and heathly family members while doing our part to help reduce the pet population by spaying and neutering.
