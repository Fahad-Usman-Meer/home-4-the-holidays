Ruth Steinert Memorial SPCA's mission as a no kill shelter is to protect the welfare of all domestic animals and promote the humane treatment & well being of these animals by the following:

-Providing shelter and medical care for stray, abandoned, & unwanted animals in Schuylkill County Pennsylvania.
-Responding with personal commitment, humane sensitivity, & compassion to the needs of these animals.
-Actively promoting suitable adoptions of these animals.
-Encouraging the spay & neutering of dogs & cats to prevent further pet overpopulation.

The animals in our care are never euthanized merely because we lack space or because the animalâ€™s stay with us has exceeded a predefined amount of time.
