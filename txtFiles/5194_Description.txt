<p>Frank W Felt Cat Sanctuary is named after my late father Frank {Bill} W Felt who died unexpectedly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All cats here are given advantage, are wormed, medded, ear mited if need be, are given FULL vet care, but most importantly are given one on one &amp; temperment tested so that the PURRfect match can be found for you &amp; your new FURever friend.&nbsp; This shelter is run by one single person.&nbsp; It is clean, friendly, &amp; a true joy to visit.&nbsp; The cats LOVE visitors.&nbsp; and I love to see the cats happy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Feel free to see my facebook page for more info &amp; pictures of the cats.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.facebook.comceloronnycatrescue">www.facebook.comceloronnycatrescue</a>.&nbsp; </p>
