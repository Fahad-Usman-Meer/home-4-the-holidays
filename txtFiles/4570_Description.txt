<p>Here at the Bathurst SPCA we strive to give as many animals a chance at a new life. We are always amazed with the strength of an animal's spirit, and how, with a little TLC, the scars of their previous life seem to heal themselves. We house about 1,000 animals each year, which means 1,000 different personalities, stories and names. Each animal is just as important as the next. As Gandhi said &quot;The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated&quot;.</p>
