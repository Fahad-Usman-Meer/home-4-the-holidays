<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8238716090002537">Wish Bone Canine Rescue</span>&nbsp;is    a not-for-profit,  volunteer, no-kill organization whose primary    focus is finding responsible, loving and permanent homes for    surrendered, abandoned, neglected and abused dogs from within our    community (Bloomington/Normal, Illinois) and the surrounding areas. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>We believe all&nbsp;dogs deserve a second chance for a new beginning.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>We do not discriminate based on a dog&rsquo;s breed, age or health. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>We&nbsp;believe   in the importance of placing each dog in a  loving and caring home   environment as soon as possible. This is  accomplished exclusively   through our foster home program.</li>
    <li>We   place great emphasis on the rehabilitation of sick and  unsocialized   dogs, providing them with&nbsp;all&nbsp;necessary veterinary care.&nbsp;  </li>
    <li>We spay/neuter all of our foster dogs. </li>
    <li>We are advocates of educating the public&nbsp;in the areas of&nbsp;proper&nbsp;canine care and&nbsp;responsible pet ownership.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
While   the dedicated volunteers at Wish Bone Canine Rescue would  prefer to rescue   every animal in need, they understand their  limitations and live by the   guiding principle:&nbsp;<br />
<p align="center" dir="ltr">&ldquo;saving just one animal won&rsquo;t change the world&hellip;<br />
but, surely, the world will change for that one animal.&rdquo;</p>
