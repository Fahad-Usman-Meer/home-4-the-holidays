We are an all-breed inclusive rescue advocating on behalf of all animals. We have applied for our 501c3 non-profit status. Our mission is to rescue healthy, loving animals that are on death row, in or community shelters, &amp; give them a 2nd chance at life. We are committed to finding the best homes, for these amazing creatures, ones in which they can flourish &amp; live out their natural lives surrounded by loving care &amp; kindness. Our policy is not 1st come 1st served, but rather which family would be the best possible match for our furry friends in need. Our dogs are vaccinated, spayed/neutered &amp; started on heartworm prevention. Thank you for rescuing a dog &amp; saving a wonderful life. FIND US ON PETFINDER.ORG &amp; FACEBOOK!!!</p>
