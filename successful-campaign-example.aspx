                                                          <p align="left">There are many pages of  helpful suggestions and ideas to promote Home 4 the Holidays, but one of our participants  did a particularly outstanding job of creating a special event to promote Home  4 the Holidays and working with the local government to secure a proclamation  regarding Home 4 the Holidays.&nbsp; This is a  perfect example of how creating a special day to celebrate Home 4 the Holidays  can draw in visitors and significantly increase adoptions.&nbsp; The proclamation is not difficult to get and  usually involves simply drafting a letter to your local politician, but it is  something that will look great in your lobby for potential adopters and can be  included in a press release for the event.</p>
