  <h1>Keep the Light Shining and Send  Orphan Pets Home 4 the Holidays</h1>
  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
  <h2>Promote Pet Adoption by Using <strong>#LightTheirWayHome</strong></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What is the Blue Buffalo Home 4 the Holidays® Campaign?</strong> Home 4 the Holidays is a three-month adoption drive that saves the lives of  orphan pets and raises awareness about the importance of pet adoption during  the holiday season. More families bring a new pet home during the holiday  season than at any other time of the year.   The campaign has become the largest pet adoption campaign on record,  saving over 10 million pets since its inception in 1999.</p>
  <p> Home 4 the Holidays encourages individuals to choose pet  adoption over supporting puppy mills and backyard breeders, and finding your  new pet this holiday season is easy!   With a collective group of over 4,000 pet adoption agencies, facilities  and rescue-groups uniting on the Home 4 the Holidays campaign, your next friend  is just a click away!  </p>

  <h3>Other Ways You Can Help Pets</h3>
  <p><strong>Post, Tweet, and Share Pets Available for  Adoption</strong><br>
    A great way  to help pets find homes is simply by talking about them. Find a local pet  adoption organization near you and share pets looking for homes on Facebook,  Twitter or Instagram. Be sure to include a link to the pet adoption  organization&rsquo;s website!</p>
  <p><strong>Volunteer or Fundraise at Your Local Pet  Adoption Organization</strong><br>
    You don&rsquo;t  need to know the ins and outs of animal behavior to help a pet adoption  organization. Many orgs need help in the following areas: office tasks, answering  the phone, taking photos/videos of adoptable pets, or simply directing guests  who come in looking for pet adoption. Reach out to your local org today!</p>
