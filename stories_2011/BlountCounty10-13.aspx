<p>In 2009, while the Blount County Humane Society was renovating  their All Creatures Thrift Store, a gray tabby cat wandered onto the premises and  decided to make the thrift store her new home.&nbsp; The BCHS members named her  Belle and she soon became the official store cat. She held that position until  she was ready for adoption.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belle has been up for adoption for a long time but she was adopted  this past weekend by an amazing girl named Olivia. They are absolutely in love  with each other. Here is a picture of Belle at her new home enjoying the  sunshine from her window.&nbsp;</p>
