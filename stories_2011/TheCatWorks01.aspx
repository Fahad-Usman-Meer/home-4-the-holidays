<p>  Roscoe, a 2-year-old Jack Russell blend, was found in the  woods and brought to Moore Humane Society in Carthage, North Carolina, as a  stray in July, 2011. An alert and friendly pooch, he was always ready to play  in the yard with other dogs and go for walks with volunteers. He attended  several adoption events at PetSmart and AutumnFest, a fair in downtown Southern  Pines. No one could pass by his kennel without stopping to offer a treat, or a  scratch behind his big ears.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Time went by. New dogs came in and soon left with their  adopting families, but Roscoe remained behind.&nbsp;  Many volunteers expressed surprise since he was such a great dog, so  friendly, so playful.</p>
<p>  They say that every gray cloud has a silver lining and that  some things are just meant to be. Luckily, for Roscoe, both of these adages  held true. </p>
<p>  Enter Corporal Flowers, an officer with the Canine Unit of  the Carthage Police Department, who responded when Nacho, one of our kittens,  was stolen from our Kitten Room. Corporal Flowers and other members of the  Carthage Police Department worked to locate and arrest the perpetrators, and to  rescue the kitten. When he returned Nacho to the Shelter, Officer Flowers  decided to take a look at the dogs&hellip; because he always wanted&hellip; a Jack Russell  terrier! Was it fate? Was it luck? Who knows&hellip; but one look at Roscoe and  Officer Flowers was smitten!&nbsp; </p>
<p>The  paperwork was completed and Roscoe joined his &ldquo;fur-ever&rdquo; family!&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Officer Flowers has reported back to us that Roscoe loves  snuggling in bed and romping in the backyard with the family&rsquo;s pig!&nbsp; As part of his obedience training, he is  learning that the chickens are not to be chased; we suspect that before long, he&rsquo;ll  be their valiant protector!</p>
