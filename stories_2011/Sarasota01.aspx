<p>  A young lady had emailed me, saying she was  interested in adopting one of two particular dogs she saw on our website.&nbsp;  I was overjoyed as these dogs have been here for quite some time.&nbsp; One is  a brindle Hound mix, and as many know, brindles are difficult to adopt in our  area in part because they are so common.&nbsp; The other, Sophie, is a black  and white terrier mix.&nbsp;On top of that, darker colored animals have an even  tougher time not being overlooked.</p>
<p>  She recently had lost her dog due to foster  care arrangements. &nbsp;Now that she was in a forever home of her own &ndash; she  wanted to, in turn, to adopt a dog just like she was adopted.</p>
<p>  Initially this lady was going to come down  during the weekend, but much to the surprise and joy of all, she came down the  very next day.&nbsp; She came down with her grandmother and grandma&rsquo;s  Yorkie.&nbsp; Never had you seen such a sight to have big Sophie get so excited  about playing with a little dog!</p>
<p>  We gave them lots of coaching before the  adoption took place, of course, but the family was elated to call Sophie their  own.&nbsp; There were some tears as we said goodbye, but nothing matched the  happiness we felt at this shelter kid finding a loving forever home, at long  last!</p>
