<p>From Lil&rsquo;Tykes Rescue and Adoption,  located in Alabama</p>
<p>Every year the Auburn University of  Montgomery located in Montgomery, Alabama, holds an Adopt-A-Thon inviting both  rescuers and shelters alike to come together for a few hours with the hope of  placing of our rescues into new forever homes.</p>
<p>We are so excited about these  adoptions as some of these pets have been at our rescue for two years or more:</p>
<p>Darla has been with Lil'Tykes since 2009.  No one really wanted her because she has a noticeable scar over her left eye. A  family adopted her and said her scar gave her character. She is finally in that  forever home!</p>
<p>Etowah is a Schnauzer mix, short with  wiry hair, and cute as a button. She came to us from north Alabama during the tornado  season. She found her home with a couple that fell in love with her character.  She now lives in Georgia!</p>
<p>Faith is a Jack Russell and Dachshund  blend who was given up by a military family that was moving and couldn't take  her along. She stole the hearts of a young boy and his mom and went home with  them.</p>
<p>Izzy is a Schnauzer Poodle blend that  came to us from a military family as well. Her brother had already left, but Izzy  was still looking for a home. &nbsp;She found  her way into a family&rsquo;s heart who had three teenagers. What a great day for  Izzy!</p>
<p>Anyhow, we wanted  you to know we had  an awesome day for our rescues, about 200 more need homes, but in the meantime they  have us at Lil'Tykes. </p>
