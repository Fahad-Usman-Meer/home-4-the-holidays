<p>&ldquo;Bob and Pooh Bear&rdquo;<br />
  Bob and Pooh Bear had a very rough start  to their young lives. Bob, a 1-year-old Cocker Spaniel blend, and Pooh Bear, a 3-year-old  old Cocker Spaniel blend, were living in an unhealthy living situation until  the Humane Society of Greater Dayton stepped in.<br />
  <br />
  Both dogs were brought to the shelter to start their new lives and to  eventually find their forever homes. They were very fearful and nervous for the  first couple of weeks at the facility. Though they were scared, their sweet  demeanor always showed through. <br />
  <br />
  Once they came out of their shell, Bob and Pooh Bear were always the first to  greet the animal care workers every morning and loved the attention they  received from them and from prospective pet owners that visited the kennels. <br />
  <br />
  Both dogs were taken to an adoption event a month after they arrived at the  Humane Society. A half an hour before the event was to end, a family came over  to meet them. It truly was &quot;love at first sight.&quot; The family fell in  love with both boys and their friendly personalities. They quickly decided to  fill out an adoption application, were approved, and as the event ended,  adopted both dogs. <br />
  <br />
  You could see the love the dogs had for the adoption care workers that were at  the event; those same employees were the ones they loved to greet each morning.  The love from their new family was also very apparent; they were thrilled to be  adopting these sweet dogs. <br />
  <br />
  Though their story started off sad, the ending is much happier. Bob and Pooh  Bear are now in their forever home, getting the love and attention they've  always deserved. </p>
