<p>From Escambia Animal Services, Pensacola, Florida</p>
<p>  Our loving story today is from a lady who  came in looking for two Siamese kittens to adopt.&nbsp;She brought two of her  children to look with her.&nbsp;She has an older Siamese cat at home and was  wanting to get some kittens to join their family.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  When her family came in today they fell  in love with a whole family of Siamese kittens.&nbsp; It was quite fortuitous  actually that the kittens were two boys and a girl and she has two boys and a  girl of her own! </p>
<p>  She said it was meant to be and that each  of her children now has their very own kitten to care for and love.&nbsp; The  two children that came in with her today were so happy and excited.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  They went home that night to get kitten  toys and treats for their new family members and returned the day after to pick  them up after their spay and neuter surgeries. </p>
