<p><a href="http://www.huronhumanesociety.org/">From Huron  Humane Society</a>, Alpena, Michigan<br />
Emily came to stay at the Huron Humane Society on July 24,  2011.&nbsp; She was found lying in the middle  of a busy street, very pregnant, exhausted, and hungry. Poor Emily! Her fur was  matted and she was very dirty and full of fleas. <br />
We gave her a bath, fed her and set her up a bed in the  office under a staff member&rsquo;s desk so she would feel safe and secure. The next  day, no one called or came for her - we were very surprised. <br />
You see Emily is a Brussells Griffon, a very expensive breed  of dog. How could no one be looking for her? Emily seemed content in the office  with us and we had already fallen in love with her so that was &ldquo;her new spot.&rdquo;<br />
About a week after she came in, a woman named Donna entered the  shelter and immediately wanted to know all about Emily. She fell in love and  Emily was placed on hold for her, knowing that she would have to stay at the  shelter until her puppies were done nursing. We were so happy that Emily was  already on hold! Normally, it is the pups that go first and then the mom.<br />
On August 6, 2011, Emily went into labor, and because of her  age, she had some complications and a veterinarian was called in. By morning  all four pups were born two males and two females and Emily was doing  fine.&nbsp; <br />
Donna called to check to see how Emily was doing at least  twice a week and when the pups were 6 weeks, we weened them, and gave Emily a  bed and dishes that her new mom had brought in.&nbsp; <br />
Emily was spayed and Donna picked her up to enter her new  home and life. &nbsp;Emily is now spending her  time lounging around, traveling and being loved and spoiled.&nbsp; We are all so happy for Emily, in our hearts  we know that Emily came to the shelter for a reason, to give and receive love. </p>
