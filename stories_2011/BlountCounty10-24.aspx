<p>Biggun, an adorable black Dachshund,  was brought to the city shelter by his owner. He was terribly overweight (22  lbs) and his little belly dragged the ground. He had been kept in a crate most  of his life and had scabbed callouses on his back legs. He also had a skin fungus  between the rolls of fat. Even his little tail had a pocket of fat around it  where it connected to his body. Because of all these problems, he looked to be  about nine years old.</p>
<p>This sweet little guy was the one  hundredth animal to be pulled from the city shelter by the Blount County Humane  Society. Biggun was placed in foster care with Cathy, who put Biggun on a  healthy diet and exercise program. He had a fenced-in yard was able to be  outside with Cathy's other Dachshunds. He was finally free to run and play and  be a real dog!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Biggun's skin improved: the fungus  cleared up and his coat became shiny and soft. However, he still has callouses  and the skin on his legs may never shrink back to normal. </p>
<p>Biggun got down to a perfect 16 lbs,  and it was determined that he is only about six years old!</p>
<p>After three and a half months, a  couple saw Biggun on Petfinder.com and filled out an adoption application with  the BCHS. The couple adopted Biggun and they have turned out to be the perfect  match!</p>
<p>Biggun's new daddy says that Biggun is the best fishing buddy he  has ever had!</p>
