<p><a href="http://ahelpingpaw.org/">From A Helping Paw</a>, Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts</p>
<p>Little Luke, a 9 pound  terrier blend, didn't understand why &ldquo;mommy&rdquo; no longer played with him. She was  never home to take him for the walks he loved so much. Most days his supper was  late and his little belly would growl as he heard her come through the door.  Time was a bit confusing to him as most often he spent ten hours or more in his  kennel. He knew something wasn't right but he couldn't understand what caused  his 'mommy' to ignore him. </p>
<p>How do you explain  to&nbsp;your dog that you've lost your well-paying job and now to make it by on  your own you have to work two jobs? How do you explain to your dog that you'd  love to spend time with him but no longer have that luxury? How do you explain  to your dog that though you adore him, you can no longer care for him? </p>
<p>Sometimes we love someone  enough to give them the best even though it hurts us, and that is exactly what  this woman did. Luke was surrendered to A Helping Paw, in a city and state, his  original owner knew we would find him the best possible home. </p>
<p>We knew we had the right  match the second the couple walked into the doggie room. Luke took one look and  fell in LOVE! He said, &quot;These are my new parents!&rdquo; Though he normally  greeted visitors with a smile, he tended to back off until he felt safe. Not  with this couple! They were hardly sitting before he jumped into the woman's lap,  filling her face with doggie kisses. After 15 minutes, the couple had this look  on their face - it was the look of&nbsp;total LOVE! </p>
<p>Not only is this a happy  ending for Luke, but his new &ldquo;dad&rdquo; suffers from disabling back pain leaving him  unable to work and alone most days. Luke will never be left home alone again.  Obviously we couldn't have found a more appropriate match. Now Luke and his &ldquo;dad&rdquo;  spend every moment together enjoying each other's company - days filled with  joy! </p>
