          <p><em>&ldquo;As an advocate  for pet adoption and saving a life, as well as an adopted pet owner, I am in  full support of charities like Home 4 The Holidays. As an LA native, I feel my  community is made of a majority of pet lovers, but lacking education on why it  is so important to adopt rather than buy. I would love to be a leader and  teacher, in bringing awareness and homes for pets that need it most.&rdquo;</em></p></td>
