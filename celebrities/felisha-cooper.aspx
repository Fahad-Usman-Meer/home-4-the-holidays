          <p>Born and raised in Fayetteville, NC, Felisha  Cooper knew at a young age that she wanted to be in front of the cameras and  amongst an elite class of actors.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>            Her notable credits include a series regular on the CBS Daytime  series THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL &amp; Viaplay&rsquo;s SWEDISH DICKS; as well as an  episode of NCIS: LOS ANGELES, and before that, a recurring role on TNT's THE  LAST SHIP, and also completed a supporting role in the recent WHITNEY biopic  for Lifetime, directed by Angela Bassett. You can also catch Felisha in national  campaigns for brands such as Sprint, Ross, Infinity, and Pepsi.</p>
          <p>            When she&rsquo;s not heating up the screen, Felisha shifts her focus to  finding ways to use her resources to uplift young women, dedicating time to  assist animal rescue shelters and using her celebrity to promote organizations  that support the Paraplegic and United States Veteran communities. </p>
          <p><em>&ldquo;Pet adoption is  important to me because these beautiful, sweet animals, who need homes, are  left abandoned and are lacking love. </em></p>
        <p><em> I, personally, love all animals and am so thankful for my little  Presley, he's a cat. He is the sweetest boy, and I think we should all do more  to make sure these wonderful creatures have safe &amp; loving homes.&rdquo; </em></p></td>
