<p>Our partner  organizations deserve the best! That&rsquo;s why Helen Woodward Animal Center and  Blue Buffalo are again teaming up to give away&nbsp;three times the  prizes&nbsp;for Blue Buffalo Home 4 the Holidays 2021. <br>
  We want to show the  world why pet adoption is both beautiful and life-changing! What better way to  do it than share our amazing adoption stories on social media. <br>
  During Home 4 the  Holidays (October 1, 2021, to January 2, 2022) when your adopters from Home 4  the Holidays partner organizations tag newly adopted pet photos or video with  the hashtag&nbsp;<strong><em>#IChoseToRescue</em></strong>&nbsp;and tag&nbsp;<strong><em>@hwac</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>@bluebuffalo</em></strong>&nbsp;on  Twitter or Instagram, they will be entered to win a year&rsquo;s supply of Blue  Buffalo pet food for their pet and a $1,000 donation to the organization they  adopted from.&nbsp;(Hey, that&rsquo;s you!)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Not on Twitter or Instagram? Not to worry, your adopters can post their newly  adopted pet right&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.home4theholidays.org/">www.home4theholidays.org</a>&nbsp;when the contest begins on October  1, 2021. <br>
  <strong>Contest Timeline</strong> <br>
