  <h2><strong>Join the world&rsquo;s  largest adoption campaign with Blue Buffalo® Home 4 the Holidays®</strong></h2>
  <p> Home 4 the Holidays is a three month adoption drive that  saves the lives of orphan pets and raises awareness about the importance of pet  adoption during the holiday season.&nbsp; Why? More families bring a new pet  home during the holiday season than at any other time of year.</p>
  <img src="_images/H4TH_historic_logo_08.jpg" align="right" width=200/>
  <p>    This campaign is dedicated to educating the public about the  importance of choosing pet adoption over supporting puppy mills and backyard  breeders.&nbsp; Through our collective group of over 4,000 pet adoption  agencies, facilities, and rescue-groups, this campaign has become the largest  pet adoption campaign on record, saving over&nbsp;18 million pets&nbsp;since  its inception in 1999.</p>
